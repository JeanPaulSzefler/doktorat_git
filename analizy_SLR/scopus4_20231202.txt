ABSTRACT: Given the growing global interest on the university's role towards promoting sustainability, an increasing number of universities are committing themselves to sustainability. Nonetheless, many of university stakeholders and academicians are unaware of sustainability principles. In the lack of sufficient studies to investigate the perceptions of major stakeholders within the university-setting on the role of the university in contributing to sustainability, the current study aims to investigate the perceptions of university students towards factors of a sustainable university by developing a reliable scale to assess sustainability practices of universities. Through examining the perception of 379 university students, a standard scale design process was applied. Upon validation of the proposed scale, a four-dimensional structure for the key factors of a sustainable university from the perspective of students was identified, including 1) community outreach, 2) sustainability commitment and monitoring, 3) waste and energy, and 4) land use and planning. Finally, implications were discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This paper aims to investigate entrepreneurship course offerings in business administration/management curricula in sub-Saharan higher education institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a survey of online course catalogs to analyze entrepreneurship course offerings. Findings: The results of the study demonstrate that most higher education institutions in the sample offer courses in entrepreneurship and/or small business management but few offer specialization in the area. Newly created institutions are more likely to offer entrepreneurship courses and specializations than traditional ones while a few operate university-based entrepreneurship centers. The study findings are consistent with the environmental school of entrepreneurial thought. Research limitations/implications: The study depended exclusively on online data. Several institutions were excluded from the sample because their web sites were unavailable. Future research should use a larger sample. Practical implications: The paper will assist researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders in higher education in strengthening the discussion about enterprise and entrepreneurship education in sub-Saharan business programmes. Originality/value: This is the first study on the content of entrepreneurship courses in sub-Saharan African Universities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Tertiary assessment policy and practice address multiple purposes that can both complement and contradict one another. This mixed-method study employing both quantitative and qualitative data builds on the results of a large-scale survey of academic staff and student conceptions of assessment with a follow-up analysis of staff comments, systematic review of institutional policy documents and individual interviews with senior academic managers. Institutional policy patterns are evaluated in light of issues emerging from the survey data as well as the international research literature. Based on the findings, the article concludes with recommendations for the design of quality policy and practice guidelines to ensure that tertiary assessment is manageable, valid, equitable and has the integrity required by stakeholders in higher education institutions. © 2010 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to illustrate that values-focused assessment can provide a useful lens for integrating sustainability and institutional performance assessment in universities. Design/methodology/approach – This study applies a values elicitation methodology for indicator development, through thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews and a stakeholder workshop, in a pilot project at BOKU University, Vienna. Findings – This case highlights that many of the values held by university staff and students are pro-sustainability values. Starting from these values may be a useful way of engaging university stakeholders in sustainability dialogues. The paper illustrates how values-based indicators can be integrated into university performance assessments, providing a novel way of thinking about sustainability assessment in universities. Research limitations/implications – The exploratory pilot was carried out in a university with a focus on natural sciences. Further research could replicate and compare the results of this paper in other institutions. Originality/value – Creating a shared understanding of pro-sustainability values can help individuals to reconceptualise sustainability in relation to their own work and motivations. In doing so, it can highlight the inherent synergies between sustainability assessment and institutional performance assessment in the higher education sector, which are usually seen as separate domains. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Numerous changes in higher education (e.g., the demand for accountability, threats to tenure, new modes of instruction) and discontent with narrow definitions of scholarship have created the need for a broader and more precise definition of the nature of scholarship in psychology. The 5-part definition that we propose includes (a) original research (creation of knowledge), (b) integration of knowledge (synthesis and reorganization), (c) application of knowledge, (d) the scholarship of pedagogy, and (e) the scholarship of teaching in psychology. Scholarly activities require high levels of discipline-specific expertise, are innovative, can be replicated, are documented, can be subject to peer review, and have significance. This broader conceptualization of scholarship will benefit all stakeholders in higher education -students, faculty, colleges and universities, the community, and society at large.

ABSTRACT: Objective: Given the inequitable impact of COVID-19 on sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth and current sociopolitical racial justice concerns in the United States, this study examines the impact of SGM-related family rejection and racism since the start of COVID-19 on SGM-related internalized homophobia and identity concealment among SGM college students of color (SOC). Method: Participants were a subset of SOC (n = 200) from a larger nonprobability cross-sectional study about minority stress and COVID-19 pandemic experiences among SGM college students. Participants completed survey items specifically related to changes in minority stress and racism experiences since the start of COVID-19. Logistic regression models were used to examine the independent and interactive effects of racism and family rejection on identity concealment and internalized homophobia since the start of COVID-19 (adjusting for covariates). Results: Main effects models revealed that increased racism and family rejection were significantly associated with greater odds of experiencing identity concealment since the start of COVID-19. The interaction of increased racism and family rejection was also significantly associated with greater odds of experiencing identity concealment since the start of COVID-19. Conclusions: Study findings suggest that the intersection of racism and family rejection since the start of COVID-19 consequently translates to increased experiences of identity concealment. Such experiences are known to negatively impact mental health across the life course among SGM young people. Public health, medical, mental health, and higher education stakeholders must implement SGM-affirmative and antiracist practices and interventions to support SGM SOC during COVID-19 and beyond its containment © 2022 American Psychological Association

ABSTRACT: Digitalization and transition to a new technological structure bring humanity to another level of development. The changing technological structures, industry and society progress, enhance the importance of improving the university development model. The existing management system and infrastructure in universities are often outdated and unable to ensure their competitive and adequate functioning. Hence, the need to improve the processes of using the university infrastructure through digital technology. The composition and range of the resources should also be reviewed and supplemented with new components. The purpose of this work is to reveal the principles and requirements for improving the university infrastructure using digital technology. The methodology is based on modeling the university management system, with the concept of infrastructure logic as a core, meant to include new elements in the university management infrastructure: university stakeholders, cultural values, investments and translation. The management model transformation implies a transition from structural to infrastructural approach, from infrastructure management to managing the infrastructure logic. The digital network platform incorporating the information on all the infrastructure facilities, their status, will provide effective user access management to each university resource. The recommendations formulated to improve the university infrastructure using digital technology will make higher education more effective. © 2020, Sciedu Press. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This paper aims to report strategies towards a green campus project at Politecnico di Torino University, a 33,000-students Italian higher education institution (HEI), and estimate the avoided ecological footprint (EF) of different scenarios accounted for open spaces. Design/methodology/approach: A consumption-based study has been developed to analyse the current EF of the main campus site. Data were collected from different departments and administrative units to identify the measure of the pressure exerted by the campus activities on the ecosystem. Then, possible scenarios were accounted for open spaces along five different design layers: energy, water, landscape, food and mobility. Acting on the spaces by means of biophilic design and user-driven design requires complex considerations on university’s anticipated future needs and a wide-ranging evaluation of the most appropriate pathways forward according to all university stakeholders, far beyond the mere accounting of avoided EF. Findings: A reduction of the 21 per cent of the current EF can be achieved through the solutions envisaged in the green campus project along the open space layers. Moreover, universities have the opportunity to not only improve the sustainability of their facilities but also demonstrate how the built environment can be designed to benefit both the environment and the occupants. Research limitations/implications: The acknowledgement of predicted behavioural change effects is a question left open to further researchers on methods and indicators for social impact accounting and reporting in truly sustainable university campuses. Originality/value: This is the first research that estimates the EF of an Italian HEI. The research represents also an innovative approach integrating the EF reduction scenarios in the design process of the new masterplan of open spaces, trying to identify the connection between environmental impact reduction and improvement in users’ perception. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: The present paper analyses the relevance of academic engagement in the process of students dropping out of school. Previous studies have consistently shown strong associations between engagement and students' achievement outcomes. The increased attention given to academic engagement in recent years is also visible in the efforts of stakeholders in higher education to increase engagement and, consequently, to reduce dropout. The relationships between engagement and dropout rates are somewhat fuzzier, vigor, dedication, and absorption vary inconsistently in students at risk. Using a correlation research design, we tested several dimensions of academic engagement as predictors of early dropout intentions on a sample of first-year students (N = 1063). The results showed that psychological academic engagement of students is a significant predictor of early dropout intentions. Differences in academic engagement given by family background and academic context were also tested. The implications of the results are discussed in the light of possible interventions for increasing academic engagement of university students. Also, suggestions for including employers in academic engagement and dropout interventions are given. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Afro-Caribbean international students (ACIS) often become engrossed in a complex racial and ethnic dialogue wherein they are thrust into homogenous categorizations forcing them to negotiate their Afro-Caribbean self with other identities perceived by others such as African American, first- and second-generation Caribbean immigrant, African, and Latin American. This tendency to homogenize ACIS overlooks their experiences and development, and so their issues become essentially invisible for administrations and in the literature on student identity development. Therefore, higher education stakeholders are unaware of the needs unique to these students (Lacina, 2002; Szelényi & Chang, 2002). This is particularly problematic given that ACIS students are less likely to have high-quality educational and social experiences impacting their development (Anderson, Carmichael, Harper, & Huang, 2009). The purpose of this study is to investigate the ethnic identity development of ACIS at a public research-intensive university in the US Southeast with particular attention on how these students negotiate their identities given the current homogenized discourse on ACIS. © 2014, Johns Hopkins University Press.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the potential for digital badges to support alternate learning and career pathways in formal and informal learning environments. Stakeholder groups in higher education and industry discussed how digital badges might transform current processes of admitting undergraduate students and hiring young professionals. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses a thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with 30 stakeholders in higher education and the technology industry. Findings: Interview participants expressed optimism about the potential for digital badges to make learning pathways visible to learners and external audiences and to promote equity in STEM (STEM: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education and careers. Participants noted several obstacles, largely focused on issues of credibility and logistics of working with badges across settings. Research limitations/implications: Though the research approach is limited in geographic scope, the findings have broad applicability and insight for the use of digital badges in general. Practical implications: Education policymakers, employers and scholars will be able to use the insights from this investigation in their efforts to find innovative ways to expand and diversify the STEM workforce, as well as support a wider range of learners than is currently supported by initiatives aligned with the school-to-workforce pipeline metaphor. Originality/value: This paper directly confronts issues of real-world applications of digital badges by discussing practical implications with college admissions officers and employers. The current study fills a need for research that investigates the use of digital badges across – as opposed to within – contexts. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Action researchers have rarely focused attention on reforming higher education and I argue that this is a mistake. The article reviews some of my failed attempts to make AR a sustainable teaching, research, and extension strategy in my own university. These experiences show that AR works well in the classroom and in small and marginal projects but this small scale and marginality and invisibility also makes such efforts fragile and short-lived. We action researchers have yet to use AR strategies successfully to guide necessary reforms in the relation between universities and the extra-university stakeholders and to deepen collaborative relationships within universities among students, staff, and administrators. © 2007, Sage Publications.

ABSTRACT: The reporting of intellectual capital (IC) in higher education institutions is of vital importance, mainly owing to the fact that knowledge is the main output and input in these institutions. Furthermore, the increasing social concern about establishing procedures of accountability and ensuring information transparency in public universities prompted us to consider the need to disclose information on their IC. In this study, we developed a questionnaire that was sent to members of the Social Councils of Spanish public universities in order to identify the intangible elements about which university stakeholders demand most information. It was also used to see which groups of universities have stakeholders who are more proactive to the disclosure of IC. Our results represent a starting point for public universities to identify the most commonly requested information about IC. Universities can then develop an IC report that fits their own characteristics and environment. © 2015 Operational Research Society. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Higher education for the 21st century continues to promote discoveries in the field through learning analytics (LA). The problem is that the rapid embrace of of LA diverts educators’ attention from clearly identifying requirements and implications of using LA in higher education. LA is a promising emerging field, yet higher education stakeholders need to become further familiar with issues related to the use of LA in higher education. Few studies have synthesized previous studies to provide an overview of LA issues in higher education. To address the problem, a systemic literature review was conducted to provide an overview of methods, benefits, and challenges of using LA in higher education. The literature review revealed that LA uses various methods including visual data analysis techniques, social network analysis, semantic, and educational data mining including prediction, clustering, relationship mining, discovery with models, and separation of data for human judgment to analyze data. The benefits include targeted course offerings, curriculum development, student learning outcomes, behavior and process, personalized learning, improved instructor performance, post-educational employment opportunities, and enhanced research in the field of education. Challenges include issues related to data tracking, collection, evaluation, analysis; lack of connection to learning sciences; optimizing learning environments, and ethical and privacy issues. Such a comprehensive overview provides an integrative report for faculty, course developers, and administrators about methods, benefits, and challenges of LA so that they may apply LA more effectively to improve teaching and learning in higher education. © 2016 Online Learning Consortium.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The modern knowledge-based economy acknowledges the role of the third mission of universities related to the process of knowledge transfer as a driving force to face sustainability issues, in addition to the two traditional missions focusing on research and teaching. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationships between internal environment, external environment, knowledge exploitation, knowledge exploration and university performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to test the conceptual model in the Chinese education system. Findings: The findings confirm the higher impact of internal environment on both knowledge exploitation and knowledge exploration as compared to external environment. Knowledge exploitation is more strongly related to university performance than knowledge exploration. These results highlight the imperative role of internal university stakeholders in fostering knowledge management strategies. In addition, they encourage academicians, practitioners and policy makers to focus their attention on the impact of knowledge management models, tools and practices in universities to achieve the entrepreneurial development which, in turn, has a positive impact on individual graduates and innovation ecosystems. Originality/value: The necessity to develop a more entrepreneurial university, as well as the lack of evidence of their development in emerging countries, highlights the need to investigate how specific factors and knowledge management processes are impacting the universities’ performance. In fact, although previous studies provide an explanation of the impact of internal and external factors on a university’s performance, contributions integrating these concepts with strategic knowledge management processes are still lacking. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This study aims to build on embedded approaches to stakeholder management and examines how organizational decision-makers consider social responsibility toward proximal stakeholders in crises that encompass an entire system of stakeholder relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Within a criterion-based sample of eight Latin American private universities, this paper develops in-depth exploratory case studies to examine the prioritization of stakeholders in higher education institutions’ decision-making during the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis. Findings: Contrary to the notion that during crises organizations prioritize stakeholders that provide resources that are critical to survival, this study finds that in contextual crises stakeholder management is informed by social responsibility. In addition, the findings suggest that crises may be tipping points for changes toward mission-driven approaches to governance. Practical implications: Acknowledging the roles of social responsibility and proximity in stakeholder management during contextual crises allows for more informed governance of organizations that face disruptions in their system of stakeholder relations. Originality/value: This study contributes unique insights into the decision-maker’s prioritization of stakeholders during the COVID-19 crisis. The uncertainty associated with the emerging “new normal” allowed for an extreme test of socially embedded versus resource-oriented approaches to stakeholder management. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: In the global knowledge economy, attracting and retaining talent is the most important mutual goal of universities and cities. They work together in the worldwide competition for talent. The locations of universities play an important role in the competitive profile of cities and regions because they concentrate this human capital. Simultaneously, the ideal university campus is increasingly resembling a city, with hotels and housing, restaurants, cafés, cultural and sports facilities, business space, and the traditional office and academic space. The campus of the future could be “the city” or “a city” in itself. The authors of this chapter seek to deepen understanding of the dynamic campus–city relations by describing the past, present, and future trends of the physical settings and functional mix of campuses. They discuss two extreme campus models and their associated advantages and disadvantages. The chapter might help stakeholders in universities and cities improve decisions that support their mutual goals. © 2018, The Author(s).

Can a university act as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) driver? An analysis
(2012) Social Responsibility Journal, 8 (1), pp. 77 - 86, Cited 41 times.
DOI: 10.1108/17471111211196584
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84858320605&doi=10.1108%2f17471111211196584&partnerID=40&md5=e6e43ec329d5d3df67d418cdb4a2fd32

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This paper aims to clarify the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and capacity building for sustainable livelihoods. It respects cultural differences and aims to identify the business opportunities in building the skills of employees, the community and the government. In talking about social responsibility, major attention has been drawn to CSR, yet little has been mentioned on how university stakeholders such as students can contribute to developing social responsibility. It can be said that the society of tomorrow begins today, and to make up this society, universities need to have drive, patience, and persistence to help them achieve the related goals. It is crucial for learning institutions to develop ways in which to cope with the present context demands, not only in terms of returns to the community in the form of community engagement involvement through student projects, but also in the sense of replenishing their own actions and enlarging their sources or references, so as to become institutions that help with and are partially involved in shaping a new society that is more ethical and is engaged with its community and surroundings. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines the university social responsibility (USR) initiative of 14 public and private higher learning institutions in Malaysia. Data were collected from 150 respondents using the quantitative method through survey questionnaires. Samples were selected based on the purposive sampling method, where the respondents were majoring in communication or had taken media studies. Questions took the form of open and closed-ended questions. The data gathered were then analyzed quantitatively by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Version 15). Findings: The results show that, overall, respondents are aware of the need to preserve the environment and the function and role that CSR plays in developing a more responsive public. However, the discovered lack of exposure to activities that the respondents can participate in on their own needs to be addressed. Knowledge on environmental conservation or CSR contribution may not be indicative of high levels of practice. There are many other factors that can contribute to better practices or to a lifestyle that better favors environmental conservation. Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research approach and limitations in terms of time, this study does not analyze and verify the links that exist between CSR and the environment with relation to government policy. Practical implications: Most existing research in CSR fails to take into account how universities cope with the development of CSR. Therefore, efforts to understand CSR within the university setting are significant for the development of CSR practices and conduct. Originality/value: Value from this paper is derived in three ways: first, it outlines why universities in Malaysia should move forward in determining the most relevant paths for social responsibility engagement and initiatives; second, it provides an understanding of the setting of CSR, making it easier for graduates to implement CSR at the organization they work for in the future; and finally, the data and implications drawn from Malaysia add a necessary international insight into the benefits of CSR at university level. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This article focuses on recent trends in quality assurance initiatives, analyses how the European Higher Education Area promotes quality enhancement mechanisms and their implications for quality cultures in universities. It presents and discusses two approaches towards quality enhancement both at the institutional and programme level: 1. Quality Enhancement at programme level: the Tuning approach and 2. Scottish Enhancement-led Institutional Review. It also argues that current approaches towards quality culture are reorienting the focus from quality assurance towards contextual quality enhancement and that quality enhancement becomes the primary responsibility of universities and university stakeholders. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

A Sociocultural Perspective on English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) Teachers’ Cognitions About Form-Focused Instruction

ABSTRACT: There has been much research into teacher beliefs about teaching and learning as seen in the general teacher education literature. In the field of language teacher education, this line of research has been evolving, with the recent trend being streamlined into “teacher cognition” as a generic or umbrella term. Despite increasing amounts of research output so far, research into foreign language teachers’ cognitions about their own teaching and decision-making is still insufficient, particularly with regard to university-level English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) teachers in China. Drawing on Vygotsky’s Sociocultural Theory, this qualitative research focused on EFL teachers’ cognitions about form-focused instruction in Chinese university settings. It intended to discover how teachers’ cognitions changed when they were expected to teach in actual classrooms and what factors contributed to these changes. Data collected from four teacher-participants through semi-structured interviews, classroom observations and follow-up stimulated recall interviews showed participants’ support for focus-on-form instruction, which means they not only paid attention to the grammatical form of the language but also to the meaning it is intended to convey. However, data also showed that the teacher-participants shifted from focus-on-form to focus-on-formS instruction in actual teaching, which suggests that they might have realized the challenges of carrying out teaching activities surrounding focus-on-form and would like to take an easier approach by only teaching the grammar of the language by focusing on formS. Such incongruences are interpreted with reference to a plethora of sociocultural factors including traditional Chinese thinking and institutional expectations. The implications of the findings for stakeholders in universities, including faculty members, students, and curriculum developers in similar contexts, are also discussed. © Copyright © 2021 Sun and Zhang.

ABSTRACT: Employability has become, and is likely to continue to be, a major issue for a variety of stakeholders in higher education. The article examines three competing perspectives on employability, termed here as the ‘possessive’, ‘positioning’ and ‘processual’ approaches. The first of these, based on notions of skills and attributes, dominates the policy and practice discourse but, it is argued, is deeply flawed in theoretical terms. The second perspective, based on social positioning theory, is shown to be more in accord with the evidence of employment outcomes, but tends, arguably, to lead to a ‘counsel of despair’. The processual perspective is then presented, particularly focusing on the concept of graduate identity. The article argues that this is theoretically robust, is supported by empirical evidence, and provides a sound basis for curriculum and other forms of intervention to enhance graduate employability. © 2013 Society for Research into Higher Education.

ABSTRACT: In accordance with the importance that the student stakeholder represents to universities, the objective of this research project was to identify and classify the leading expectations of students at public universities. In order to achieve this, the study adopted both the premises of Stakeholder Theory and the approaches of earlier studies on the management of university stakeholders. This empirical study began with an exploratory study of students, at one university, to identify their expectations this resulting in a list of a total of twenty-five confirmed expectations. This provided the basis for the subsequent quantitative study involving students attending eleven Portuguese public universities. Through recourse to an online questionnaire, we obtained 1,669 correctly completed surveys that provided the input for data analysis deploying descriptive statistical processes and multiple linear regressions. Our findings show that the most important student expectations are the academic level of demand, the university's connections with the employment market, student personal self-fulfillment and the prevailing university environment. According to students, these expectations should gain priority attention by university managers, once they consider them the most relevant aspects to the relationship between the student and the university.

ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic poses unparalleled challenges to education systems around the world, all of which have devastating effects. While these effects have been troubling in developing and developed countries, rural education systems in developing countries have particularly been most susceptible to collapse. The unique context of rural universities makes it difficult to implement approaches similar to those implemented in the developed world and/or more urban-based institutions. Underpinned by Von Bertalanffy's Systems Theory, which argues that organisations are composed of systems that have goals to achieve, this paper thus sought to explore the coping mechanisms instituted at a rural South African university in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. It further sought to establish how the university has managed to cope with the challenges that are unique to rural universities as exacerbated by the onset of the pandemic. Underpinned by a post-positivist paradigm, the study employed a mixed methods approach through which data was collected using online questionnaires and interviews. The findings of the study revealed that although the institution had put some measures in place to ensure that the university is efficiently managed in the context of COVID-19 stringencies, university stakeholders are still faced with insurmountable challenges that range from campus safety, cancellation and postponement of examinations, as well as weakened research and international collaborations. Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that South African institutions and the government need to invest more on safety infrastructural facilities that will ensure that rural university stakeholders are safe. Furthermore, there is a need for technical infrastructural facilities that enable the shift from conventional assessment, teaching and learning approaches to a more blended educational model. © 2021 University of Pretoria.

ABSTRACT: Progressing towards sustainable development remains a key global challenge. And yet, the various interpretations of the concept of sustainable development and the questions it raises about economic growth make its implementation difficult. Higher education institutions may help to overcome these difficulties by developing new processes of change. However, to achieve this they need to integrate sustainable development in all their areas of activity. The aim of this paper was to develop new insights into organisational change processes in universities relating to sustainable development. Contributing to this aim, this paper reports on a case study of United Kingdom higher education drawing on findings and conclusions from a survey of their policy frameworks relating to sustainable development. The method comprised a critical policy analysis in order to identify, differentiate and categorise stakeholder interactions. The data generated comprised the range of higher education stakeholders and the network of interactions that they formed. Theoretical insights from social network analysis, stakeholder theory and the normative business model were used to find opportunities to address the difficulties in the implementation of sustainable development. Results suggested that the existing networks identified in the policy frameworks may not support the effective integration of sustainable development in higher education. Low-density of the national networks; the lack of a clear governance vocabulary for national policy frameworks; and the lack of explicit funding flows between organisations all pose problems for organisational change towards sustainable development in higher education. © 2018 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Facility naming rights sponsorship is one of the fastest growing and most valuable forms of sponsorships. The limited opportunities in major league professional sports have led corporations to seek opportunities with college sports. Although collegiate athletics have become increasingly attractive for sponsorship investment, they have also been laden with potentially negative side effects. How university stakeholders perceive and respond to stadium naming rights sponsorship is a major concern for both corporations and college administrators. This study reviewed the relevant literature to propose a theoretical framework incorporating multidimensional factors of assessing consumers' perspectives (i.e., beliefs about naming rights sponsorship, attitudes toward commercialization, team and stadium identification, perception of financial status, and perceived fit) of naming rights sponsorship effectiveness. The relationships among variables were examined by reviewing related theories and previous research findings. The derived theoretical framework is expected to provide a research direction for comprehensively examining how stakeholders of intercollegiate athletic programs perceive and respond to corporate naming rights sponsorship of sport facilities. © 2010.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this paper was to explore innovative entrepreneurship and to gain insight into the educational practices and experiences that increase the likelihood that a student would graduate with innovative entrepreneurial intentions. To this end, we administered a battery of assessments to 3,700 undergraduate seniors who matriculated in the spring of 2007; these students attended one of five institutions participating in this study. Results showed that, after controlling for a host of personality, demographic, educational, and political covariates, taking an entrepreneurial course and the assessments faculty use as pedagogical strategies for teaching course content were significantly related to innovation intentions. Implications for higher education stakeholders are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

ABSTRACT: This theoretical essay uses tacit knowledge, the often-undocumented wisdom of expert practitioners and practitioner communities, to explore future prospects for the academic librarian. Traditional and emerging valuations of the academic librarian held by higher education stakeholders are identified. The practical implications of these views for university funding and other support are explored using the philosophical stance of cultural pragmatism and by applying the sociological perspective of the "stranger," tacit knowledge gained by the author as a researcher and a faculty member in an LIS program and as chair of a university Committee on the Library, and insights from a spectrum of publications. In the process, the March of Dimes, an organization that successfully repositioned itself after accomplishing its primary purpose, is examined as a possible model for enhancing the academic librarian's perceived value.

ABSTRACT: This paper traces the development of quality assurance mechanisms in Chile through the analysis of the changes in the higher education system in the country and the challenges to the quality of educational offerings presented by these changes. These mechanisms involve the establishment of compulsory licensing processes for new higher education institutions, and of voluntary programme and institutional accreditation. It then goes on to analyse the impact of these different mechanisms, even though some of them have been in operation for a brief period of time. It shows that there is some evidence of a cultural change: a system without any formal quality assurance scheme as late as 1989 now has structured mechanisms, accepted by the majority of higher education institutions and endorsed by most stakeholders in higher education. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how a cohort of university presidents and vice-presidents in Canadian universities conceptualize sustainable development, sustainable universities, the role universities play in achieving a sustainable future, key issues facing the university, and the barriers to implementing sustainability initiatives on campus. Design/methodology/approach: The research comprises in-depth interviews with university presidents (rectors) and vice-presidents from Talloires Declaration signatory universities in Canada. Interviews include both closed and open-ended questions and two checklists focused on sustainable development and sustainable universities. Interview transcripts are analyzed through the identification of respondent themes. Findings: The majority of participants are well versed in the concept of sustainable development, but less familiar with the concept of a sustainable university. The majority are dedicated to having their university become more sustainable. The most significant constraints to moving toward sustainability reported are financial predicaments, lack of understanding and awareness of sustainability issues amongst the university population, and a resistance to change. Originality/value: While higher education scholars have a reasonably common conceptualization of sustainable development and what constitutes a "sustainable university", there are few studies to date that investigate the level of sustainability knowledge of the major stakeholders within the university, or that examine what stakeholders feel is the role of the university in creating a sustainable future. If the university is tasked with responsibilities for creating a sustainable future, it is essential that all university stakeholders have a common understanding of the term sustainable development. This paper attempts to make a contribution to this significant gap in the literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Background. Both university and non-university stakeholders should be involved in the process of curriculum development in medical schools, because all are concerned with the competencies of the graduates. That may be difficult unless appropriate strategies are used to motivate each stakeholder. From 1999 to 2006, eight medical schools in Vietnam worked together to change the curriculum and teaching for general medical students to make it more community oriented. This paper describes the factors that motivated the different stakeholders to participate in curriculum change and teaching in Vietnamese medical schools and the activities to address those factors and have sustainable contributions from all relevant stakeholders. Methods. Case study analysis of contributions to the change process, using reports, interviews, focus group discussions and surveys and based on Herzberg's Motivation Theory to analyze involvement of different stakeholders. Results. Different stakeholders were motivated by selected activities, such as providing opportunities for non-university stakeholders to share their opinions, organizing interactions among university stakeholders, stimulating both bottom-up and top-down inputs, focusing on learning from each other, and emphasizing self-motivation factors. Conclusion. The Herzberg Motivation theory helped to identify suitable approaches to ensure that teaching topics, materials and assessment methods more closely reflected the health care needs of the community. Other medical schools undertaking a reform process may learn from this experience. © 2009 Hoat et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

ABSTRACT: In the context of entrepreneurial universities, new stakeholders and new roles for old ones have emerged. Accordingly, university entrepreneurship support services have to behave in a creative and innovative manner to actively support business creation at universities. This means that a common framework is necessary that includes the different stakeholders and goals, which gives a clear picture of the process of entrepreneurship encouragement and business development support (EE&BDS). We present a model for knowledge transfer and company growth within the context of entrepreneurial universities. This alternative integrative approach of the different stakeholders, actors, activities, tools, goals, and needs helps us to arrange and manage them in a better way. Our analysis allows us to show the role and relationships among the different university stakeholders and how this integrative approach contributes to the enhancement of the EE&BDS process for this institution. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

ABSTRACT: Developments in the chatbot space have been accelerating at breakneck speed since late November 2022. Every day, there appears to be a plethora of news. A war of competitor chatbots is raging amidst an AI arms race and gold rush. These rapid developments impact higher education, as millions of students and academics have started using bots like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, Ernie and others for a large variety of purposes. In this article, we select some of the most promising chatbots in the English and Chinese-language spaces and provide their corporate backgrounds and brief histories. Following an up-to-date review of the Chinese and English-language academic literature, we describe our comparative method and systematically compare selected chatbots across a multi-disciplinary test relevant to higher education. The results of our test show that there are currently no A-students and no B-students in this bot cohort, despite all publicised and sensationalist claims to the contrary. The much-vaunted AI is not yet that intelligent, it would appear. GPT-4 and its predecessor did best, whilst Bing Chat and Bard were akin to at-risk students with F-grade averages. We conclude our article with four types of recommendations for key stakeholders in higher education: (1) faculty in terms of assessment and (2) teaching & learning, (3) students and (4) higher education institutions. © 2023.

ABSTRACT: Building relationships between universities and industry bodies is of prime importance for creating value for universities' stakeholders. This paper focuses on relationships in relation to undergraduate internship programmes in the Social Sciences. Using the relationship marketing approach, we analyze this type of collaboration of firms with a large public Spanish University. We build and test a structural equations model whose results show that communication is a key building block of relationships, having a positive effect on satisfaction with the relationship, trust and functionality of conflict, and that trust and commitment increase the level of collaboration of firms with universities. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is twofold. First, it identifies the extent to which Nigerian higher education institutions (HEIs) enable the development of graduate skills and employability. Second, it outlines the roles of the major stakeholders in higher education and suggests ways to improve graduates’ knowledge, employability and skills. The study is based on a qualitative design incorporating interviews with representatives of public and private organizations, education agencies and members of non-governmental organizations in Nigeria. The data were analysed thematically to ascertain the perceptions of key stakeholders. The findings reveal that there is a minimal collaboration between HEIs and industry and many HEIs in Nigeria lack the necessary pedagogy, funding and infrastructure to carry out the teaching of employability skills. Several practical and policy implications arise from the study regarding improving graduate employability in Nigeria – in particular, the need to create a culture and environment that are conducive to HEI–industry–government collaboration and the need to design the curriculum to enable the teaching of employability skills. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: Government agencies, foundations, business and industry, and other important higher education stakeholders continue to invest in important and deep changes they think are necessary for the vitality and health of higher education particularly interdisciplinary teaching and research. But we know little about how transformational changes happen, particularly bottom up approaches required for altering the teaching/learning environment. This article reports on one of the few studies of transformational change describing case study research of 28 institutions attempting to fundamentally shift toward interdisciplinary work. The results identify the key role of sensemaking and sensegiving and build on earlier research showing how these processes change from mobilization to the implementation of change. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This article examines and evaluates the potential contributions from action learning and action research with stakeholders to higher education in agriculture and food systems.Design/Methodology/Approach: The research is based on our experiences over the past two decades of running PhD courses and an MSc degree programme in Agroecology in Norway that have attracted students from the Nordic region and other countries.Findings: We conclude that collaborating with non-university stakeholders as an integral part of a university course or programme serves four main purposes, two directly related to learning and two that can be considered as practical implications. Firstly, it enables learning about complex topics, a learning that cannot be achieved by merely reading or listening. Secondly, the real-life flare of such activities provides the students with enthusiasm and energy to delve into theory.Practical Implications: Thirdly, students collaborating with non-university stakeholders connect university and society. Fourthly, this process builds social relevance and civic engagement not found in conventional courses or curricula.Originality/Value: The article presents conceptual foundations and practical implementation of a unique educational programme in agriculture and food systems. © 2012 Copyright Wageningen University.

ABSTRACT: Growing environmental problems and increasing requirements of green jobs force universities around the world not only to transform their curricula but also to enrich existing ones with contents related to the promotion of sustainable development. This paper aims to show the importance of measuring and monitoring the share of green contents in all university activities, as only in that way it is possible to monitor trends and give realistic assessments of their effect and importance. The paper presents a comparative analysis of different types of methodologies for assessing sustainable activities at universities as well as research conducted at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia and its comparison with the University of Gothenburg (Sweden). This research aims to point out the importance of increasing competitiveness in higher education through assessment of green content in a curriculum and its promotion. In this way, through eco-labeling methodology, it would be easier to identify those contents that, in a certain share, contribute to the promotion of sustainable development. Furthermore, this methodology can easily be extended across the country and the region, which would bring positive effects to all stakeholders in higher education. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how a cohort of university faculty leaders in Canadian universities conceptualize sustainable development, sustainable universities, the role universities play in achieving a sustainable future, key issues facing the university, and the barriers to implementing sustainability initiatives on campus. Design/methodology/approach: Research was collected through in-depth interviews with university faculty leaders from university members of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada. Interviews included both closed and open-ended questions and two checklists focused on sustainable development and sustainable universities. Interview transcripts are analyzed through the identification of respondent themes and using N'Vivo software. Findings: The majority of participants demonstrated they had previously given thought to their own understanding of sustainable development, but less had thought about the term sustainable university. The majority of participants would like to see their institutions incorporate sustainability in the avenues of education, research and daily operations. Participants agreed that the most obvious barriers to sustainability were financial and that leadership, incentive and demand are required to move forward with improving sustainability at universities. Originality/value: There are few studies that explore the conceptualizations of sustainability, what constitutes a "sustainable university" and what role universities should play in achieving sustainability held by major stakeholders, including faculty leaders. Higher education scholars share a reasonably common understanding of these concepts, but if universities are accountable for creating a sustainable future, all university stakeholders too must share a common understanding.

ABSTRACT: Many years have passed since sustainable development (SD) became world famous in the Brundtland Commission publication, "Our Common Future"; however, still many universities are unaware of it or confuse it with environmental sustainability. The SD concept contrasts with existing teaching methods, mainly focused into resource depletion. This paper focuses on SD incorporation and institutionalization into universities. This process is bound to face resistance from inside and outside stakeholders. Several approaches and strategies are presented to overcome this resistance. The paper also presents the types of conflicts that might arise and the role of the campus SD champion in preventing or solving them. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Between good intentions and urgent stakeholder pressures: Institutionalizing the universities’ third mission in the Swedish context

ABSTRACT: There is a widespread recognition across Europe, amongst policy-makers, university managers and scholars, that universities’ societal roles (the ‘third mission’) are increasingly important. As universities become increasingly strategically managed, it is perhaps unsurprising that attention has turned towards the strategic management of this third mission. Universities risk becoming ‘overloaded’ with these missions and are forced to choose to dilute their strategic focus or only focus on a limited number of these missions. The third mission risks being regarded as a desirable but not an essential duty and therefore is unlikely to be an institutional focus.In this paper we therefore ask how can the third mission be meaningfully institutionalized given the pressures on university managers to focus on other areas. We explore this with reference to a detailed case study of a provincial Swedish university, Sjöstad University, with a long-standing commitment to creating a societal impact. We explore how Sjöstad University has created an impact, and then the tensions this raises for key university stakeholders, internally and with external partners. We then reflect on the institutionalization of the third mission and call for further consideration of how external stakeholders can provide universities with a strategic space to institutionalize the third mission. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Stakeholder engagement has become a norm in higher education governance in Europe, particularly in the area of quality assurance. Diverse expectations and experiences of various stakeholder groups are expected to contribute to a more effective and comprehensive quality assurance system. This paper examines empirically the assumption that stakeholders differ in their expectations. Twelve focus group interviews with main stakeholders (university rectors, employers, academic staff, government officials, students) in Estonia demonstrate that the groups indeed have somewhat different perspectives on quality assurance, according to a predictable pattern. We link the results to a theoretical discussion on stakeholder engagement, concluding that the diversity in expectations may enrich the system, but it may also force the quality agency to clarify the limits of a public quality assurance system. Furthermore, an engagement process itself may help align the diverse expectations. © 2017 International Association of Universities.

ABSTRACT: Oral presentations, activities often assessed and also a means by which learning could take place, are commonplace in higher education. General (delivery) skills in presentations are particularly useful beyond university such as in job interviews and communication with clients and colleagues in the workplace. However, little has been in place to equip learners with these vital skills. It is this very gap that motivated the research described in this article, which aimed at raising awareness of oral presentation (delivery) skills in the context of self-regulated learning. This article also reports on and discusses a compilation of an inventory of presentation skills and how learners’ awareness was raised through classroom discussion and the inventory. The implications of this article are relevant to all stakeholders in higher education. © The Author(s) 2017.

ABSTRACT: Can civic crowdfunding be used to improve the structures and services offered by public universities? Are stakeholders willing to make donations to such projects? This paper answers these questions by analysing a successful civic crowdfunding project in an Italian university. Stakeholders were found to be willing to engage in crowdfunding and make donations. The key to success is to ensure effective communication and to draw on feelings of belonging to the institution. © 2018 CIPFA.

ABSTRACT: Background: The students' progression towards completing their higher education degrees possesses stochastic characteristics, and can therefore be modelled as an absorbing Markov chain. Such application would have a high practical value and offer great opportunities for implementation in practice. Objectives: The aim of the paper is to develop a stochastic model for estimation and continuous monitoring of various quality and effectiveness indicators of a given higher education study programme. Method: The study programme is modelled by a finite Markov chain with five transient and two absorbing states. The probability transition matrix is constructed. The quantitative characteristics of the absorbing Markov chain, like the expected time until absorption and the probabilities of absorption, are used to determine chosen indicators of the programme. Results: The model is applied to investigate the pattern of students' enrolment and their academic performance in a Slovenian higher education institution. Based on the students' intake records, the transition matrix was developed considering eight consecutive academic seasons from 2008/09 until 2016/17. The students' progression towards the next stage of the study programme was estimated. The expected time that a student spends at a particular stage as well as the expected duration of the study is determined. The graduation and withdrawal probabilities were obtained. Besides, a prediction on the students' enrolment for the next three academic years was made. The results were interpreted and discussed. Conclusion: The analysis presented is applicable for all higher education stakeholders. It is especially useful for a higher education institution's managers seeing that it provides useful information to plan improvements regarding the quality and effectiveness of their study programmes to achieve better position in the educational market. © 2017 Alenka Brezavšček et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2017.

ABSTRACT: The stakeholder theory proved highly useful to some specific organisations with dispersed powers, such as is the case of universities. This theory may serve to explain the focus on varying communities in the environments surrounding these organisations as well as the relationships between organisations and communities. However, identifying and prioritising the different stakeholders to a university has not proven an easy question to resolve. Given the effective management of university stakeholders necessarily requires the correct identification of just who they are, this article seeks to identify, classify and rank the stakeholders of a university based upon a case study. To this end, we reviewed previous studies sharing similar objectives. After finding that university stakeholders have rarely been identified by empirical means, we carried out a case study on a Portuguese state university that sought to identify and qualify the importance of the respective stakeholder through such means. A series of interviews were held with fifteen individuals, connected with the institution, three from each hierarchical university level. Following content analysis of these interviews, a list containing 21 stakeholders was resulted, duly classified by importance. The final results found students, the teaching and/or research staff and employers identified as the main stakeholders. Furthermore, findings pointed to stakeholders connected to research are gaining greater importance in the contemporary university environment. Indeed, the list clarifies the complexity of universities in identifying 21 distinct groups of stakeholders making this type of organisation a managerial challenge. Given this, stakeholders need to be attributed priorities, with some prevailing over others, as it would seem impossible to attribute equal attention to them all. © 2013 Ministry Education and Science.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The present research aims to analyse the extent to which Italian public universities disclose intellectual capital (IC) information through the Integrated Plan and the main features of IC disclosure (ICD) in terms of form and location in the document. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a qualitative methodology, a content analysis is conducted to examine the level, form and location of ICD provided by a sample of 60 Italian public universities through the 2018-2020 integrated plans. Findings: The results show a medium level of ICD in the Integrated Plan, with human capital being the category most disclosed. Information is principally provided in a quantitative form and is mainly found in the first two sections of the document (i.e. relating to the strategic framework and organisational performance). Research limitations/implications: The analysis is necessarily limited to a single period (2018-2020), because of the recent introduction of the guidelines of the Integrated Plan. However, the results may be beneficial to policymakers in determining the usefulness of this new tool in detecting information about intangible resources and can help universities’ governors and managers in defining adequate IC strategies to create value for the whole ecosystem. Originality/value: The study makes an innovative contribution to the international debate about IC in universities in light of the fourth stage of IC research, exploring an emerging tool to detect whether it is able to convey IC information to the wide range of university stakeholders and to communicate the value universities contribute to society. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Despite affirmation that students with disabilities should have equal access to education, individuals with disabilities are still not participating to the same degree as individuals without disabilities, particularly within postsecondary institutions. Students in Health and Human Service (HHS) programs experience many unique challenges and disadvantages. In-depth focus groups and interviews were conducted with 14 university stakeholders in HHS programs regarding their perceptions and experiences of working with students with disabilities. We found that the rhetoric of citizenship, specifically notions of rationality, autonomy, and productivity, interacts with beliefs about students with disabilities to allow stakeholders to justify their exclusion or limited participation. Our findings demonstrate how taken-for-granted beliefs can limit the inclusion of students with disabilities in ways that seem natural and unproblematic. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: A university's key resource is its staff, both academic and general. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the work of general staff. Yet general staff comprise more than half the workforce in Australian universities and a more rigorous understanding of the contribution of general staff towards the strategic goals of their institutions has the potential to enhance their institutions' organisational sustainability. Universities have multiple and diverse stakeholders, but students are the key stakeholders in universities' core business of learning and teaching. Consequently, the interaction of general staff with students has potential to have an impact on the sustain-ability of an institution. This paper describes a preliminary study into how general staff contribute to student outcomes. A meta-study by Prebble et al. derived 13 propositions for support of student outcomes that focused on the contribution by academic staff and Middleton subsequently surmised that general staff are also central to those outcomes. This study uses the Delphi method to test Middleton's assertion by engaging general staff in ranking the propositions in terms of their contribution to student outcomes. © 2010 Association for Tertiary Education Management and the L H Martin Institute for Higher Education Leadership and Management.

ABSTRACT: Over the years, the evolution of student development theories has paved the way to include diverse students, including students with disabilities (SWD). Still, student development theories are yet to employ a view of disability as a social category and an identity. To fill this gap, the current study applies the three waves of student development theories and critical disability theory to analyze and understand how SWD perceive and experience disability support centers (DSCs), and the contribution they attribute to DSCs for their development and success in higher education and afterward. Twenty-one SWD were interviewed. The findings demonstrate the tension between policies of embracing and denying disability as a ‘difference’ and an identity in higher education. The findings also link SWD's challenges in the campus to lack of access, stigma, and the impact of power dynamics. Furthermore, the findings highlight the role of DSCs in supporting the processes of disability identification among SWD as individuals and as a group. The study emphasizes the need to strive for holistic and inclusive change in higher education policy and practice. The study may contribute to deepening understanding of the significant role of academic DSCs for the entire stakeholders in higher education and policymakers worldwide. © 2021 Society for Research into Higher Education.

Company credibility: A tool to trigger positive csr image in the cause-brand alliance context in Indonesia

ABSTRACT: Purpose of study: This research aims to analyze the mediating effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) image in the effect of company credibility dimensions (trustworthiness and expertise) on participation intention, in the cause–brand alliance (CBA) context. Methodology: The sample design which is used is purposive sampling with the sample criteria as the stakeholders of the University of Lampung, Indonesia. Data were collected by direct interview. Multiple regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses with 160 university’s stakeholders, using purposive sampling. Result: The results show that trustworthiness and expertise have a directly positive significant effect on CSR image. However, expertise statistically has a greater positive significant effect on consumer participation intention toward the CBA than trustworthiness. This finding is contrary to the contrast-effect theoretical framework (Dean, 2003) and balance theory (Heider, 1958). Newly finding is that CSR image considered a mediating role in the effect of trustworthiness and expertise credibility on participation intention. Implications: This implies that in the context of CBA, the company’s trustworthiness and expertise can be a more useful tool to trigger the positive CSR image in encouraging the stakeholders’ perception to buy the products and services or brand of the company implementing CSR, because CBA practices are considered as a genuine social cause, not as a promotion tool. Novelty/Originality of this study: In this study, the collected data uses the cross-sectional design and the CBA context uses CBA practices implemented by agriculture, education service, beverage industry, and a bank stated-owned enterprise. © Desfiandi et al.

Hierarchical microaggressions in higher education

ABSTRACT: Although there has been substantial research examining the effects of microaggressions in the public sphere, there has been little research that examines microaggressions in the workplace. This study explores the types of microaggressions that affect employees at universities. We coin the term "hierarchical microaggression" to represent the everyday slights found in higher education that communicate systemic valuing (or devaluing) of a person because of the institutional role held by that person in the institution. We explore hierarchical microaggressions through examining qualitative data from multiple cultural competence trainings devoted to learning about microaggressions on college campuses. Findings indicate 4 main types of hierarchical microaggressions: valuing/devaluing based on role/credential, changing accepted behavior based on role, actions (ignoring/excluding/surprise/interrupting) related to role, and terminology related to work position. The findings add a new dimension of interpretation to the current research on microaggressions, one that relates directly to hierarchical status of workplace identities. Hierarchical microaggressions exist in all workplaces, but are of a unique type in a university because of the rhetoric related to equality and upward mobility associated with college going. Our findings indicate that these forms of microaggressions are more than insensitive comments; they impact people because people take on an identity associated with their status at the university, an identity related to the amount of higher education they attain. This study adds to the literature on microaggressions and provides university stakeholders with the language and the tools to reduce microaggressions from their respective environments leading to the improvement of overall campus climate. © 2014 National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.

ABSTRACT: Enhancing graduate employability is a priority for many stakeholders in higher education and this research explores graduates’ experiences of, and attitudes towards, the inclusion of employability-related support in undergraduate degree programmes. A literature review is supplemented by primary research on a targeted sample of 104 graduates from humanities, sciences, engineering and social sciences, who span several generations and have over 2250 years of employment experience. The findings are triangulated to a workshop with 23 graduate careers advisory professionals. The results signal some important trends in experiences and attitudes, as well as variations by discipline and gender. While one in 10 graduates prefer a disciplinary focus with just indirect attention to employability, nine in 10 want employability to have greater emphasis, albeit those preferences vary between optional and integrated approaches. Experiences of employability-related support signal a significant shift over recent decades in how that support is provided, with professional service groups such as careers taking a much more active role and the overall level of provision rising. A cautionary note however is that the link with the discipline remains critical and the right balance needs to be struck between the provision of such support and embedding it into the curriculum. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: Purpose – This paper aims to explore at Loughborough University (UK) how informal learning spaces (ILS) are used by students in the Library and elsewhere on campus. Focus includes learning activities undertaken by students, reasons why the ILS is chosen, suggestions on how they can be improved and how technologies are used. Comparison will be drawn between how students use Library ILS and other ILS. Design/methodology/approach – Case study based at Loughborough University and its Library. Semi-structured interviews were held with 265 students in various ILS spaces across campus. Findings – Similarities and differences are present in the way students use Library ILS compared with other ILS campus spaces. These include impact of campus geography and individual academic levels of students. Research limitations/implications – This is a single case study and the results can only relate to Loughborough University. There may be some lessons and themes that are relevant to other universities. The number of interviewees is relatively small. Practical implications – Highlights the need for cooperation between various university stakeholders to strategically and operationally manage different ILS on campus. Originality/value – This is one of the very few studies that investigate together the range of ILS including the Library in a comparative approach. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Revealing opportunities and obstacles for changing non-tenure-track faculty practices: An examination of stakeholders’ awareness of institutional contradictions

ABSTRACT: Over a period of several decades, non-tenure-track faculty members (NTTF) have become a majority of instructional faculty among nonprofit higher education institutions. A growing volume of research points to a relationship between the poor working conditions or lack of support these faculty members often experience and adverse effects on student learning outcomes. Research also suggests there is limited awareness about the rising numbers of NTTFs and nature of these problems. This study utilized a modified Policy Delphi approach to surface and examine the perspectives of approximately 40 individuals representing a broad range of higher education stakeholder groups (e.g., boards, accreditation agencies, unions) about the causes and implications of rising contingency in the academic workforce. The findings suggest that awareness about how NTTF practices are inefficient and misaligned with stakeholders’ common commitments to student learning and the health of the academic profession has the potential to facilitate change. However, conditions were also identified that are currently obstacles for change. This study contributes to a better understanding of factors influencing change in higher education and suggests how a set of resonant values and interests may be evoked by change agents to increase awareness and support for revising or replacing existing NTTF practices. © 2015 by The Ohio State University.

ABSTRACT: Considering students as the key stakeholders in higher education institutions (HEIs), the present study identifies service quality (SQ) indicators from their perspectives and proposes a more comprehensive instrument for measuring SQ exclusively in HEIs. HEISQUAL covers the operational as well as technical aspects of SQ by following a holistic approach, which has largely been ignored in previous studies. The proposed instrument was subjected to different scale development tests where outcomes fully complied with the benchmark values and proposed seven SQ themes, namely teachers’ profile, curriculum, infrastructure and facilities, management and support staff, employment quality, safety and security, and students’ skills development. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: The correct management of reputation and image can be crucial to guarantee organizationś survival and success. However, the lack of clarity regarding the relationship and differences between image and reputation still exist since scholars have considered them related constructs with differences and used them interchangeably. Spanish Public Universities operate in a highly competitive sector where factors such as globalization as well as the decrease in government funding have strengthen this situation. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to measure the relationship between image and reputation in the context of Spanish Public Universities considering different university's stakeholder perceptions (students, alumni, professors, support personnel and managers). To pursue this objective, a review of literature on image and reputation was developed, followed by the distribution of 870 surveys to a Spanish Public University's stakeholders. Finally, PLS-SEM was used to analyse the data and confirm the existing relationship between image and reputation. © 2019 AEDEM

ABSTRACT: In this article the authors first highlight major challenges that higher education institutions (HEIs) are facing during the Covid-19 pandemic. They then consider the challenges HEIs should expect in the post-Covid period. In practice, HEIs are keen to maintain their core activities during the pandemic and in this context the authors examine how institutions can continue their activities efficiently by addressing issues related to the potential socio-psychological damage to stakeholders in higher education. To answer this question, they recommend the application of an all-inclusive resilience model at the beginning of the recovery period to withstand the shock of the pandemic and show how an HEI can apply the antifragile model for the advancement and betterment of the experience of individuals associated with it. The recommendations of the study contribute to the literature related to HEIs and the coronavirus, and constitute practical guidance for a post-Covid model that may be followed by HEIs around the world. © The Author(s) 2020.

Academics’ and employers’ perceptions about responsibilities for employability and their initiatives towards its development

ABSTRACT: This paper reports the results of preliminary research into how Portuguese academics and employers perceive the responsibility of different higher education stakeholders—students, teaching staff, higher education institutions, employers, and policy-makers—for developing graduate employability. The study was conducted 8 years after the implementation of the Bologna Process, the reform that placed employability firmly on the agenda of higher education institutions (HEIs) in Portugal. This paper aims to assess the extent to which higher education is held responsible for developing employability, and to characterize the activities undertaken by the two actors to achieve that end. In particular, with respect to academics, we characterize curricular and other changes to study programmes, and, with respect to employers, their participation in activities undertaken by HEIs meant to ease the transition of students to the labour market. The data comes from a survey responded to by 684 Portuguese academics and 64 employers. Academics and employers alike were found to attribute high responsibility for developing employability to higher education, suggesting that the political message of the Bologna Process regarding the relation between higher education and the labour market has been assimilated. However, the activities reported by both types of respondents indicate only an average commitment to developing employability. Here, the low participation of employers in internal institutional activities is noteworthy, suggesting that the recognition of employers as stakeholders in higher education, as advocated by policy-makers, has yet to happen in Portugal. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: In the context of globalized markets and localized R&D structures, tertiary (also called higher or university) education becomes one of the main factors facilitating economic performance. In the face of globalization and digitalization, substantial institutional changes, reforms and merges of universities represent a challenge for the higher education in the 21st century. These changes go hand in hand with economic development and global economic growth as far as higher education significantly impacts economic performance of regions and countries. European Union (EU) also faces these challenges and therefore has to promote higher education policies and invest into tertiary education in order to increase the level of human capital of its citizens with the purpose of achieving competitiveness on the global markets and higher economic growth. Our paper focuses on the reforms in higher education that are currently taking place worldwide and employ best practices occurring in universities throughout the world. In particular, we show that higher education has a positive impact on the economic performance as well as on the individual social and economic performance. We employ an empirical model that demonstrates the tertiary education has a significantly positive economic outcome for local citizens, EU citizens and third-country nationals on the example of the Federal Republic of Germany, EU largest economy and a major hub for higher education. Moreover, we compare the situation of immigrants from the EU and non-EU countries and their level of returns to higher education. Overall, it appears that current system of higher education requires deeper institutional reforms that would both reflect opening up of the EU to migrants from various non-EU countries with implication for its labour market, and recent trends in higher education. Our results might prove to be resourceful for researchers, academics, educators, policy-makers as well as for the stakeholders in higher education. © Foundation of International Studies, 2018 and CSR.

Quality in accounting education and low english standards among overseas students: Is there a link?
(2007) People and Place, 15 (1), pp. 22 - 29, Cited 37 times.

ABSTRACT: Two studies of stakeholders in university education for accounting professionals in Australia provide evidence of a decline in the quality of accounting education as perceived by accounting academics. This decline may be linked to increasing enrolments of international students with poor English language skills. Some university lecturers indicate that the quality of students entering their courses has declined, as has the quality of those graduating. In an environment increasingly dominated by the need to publish or perish, assessment tasks such as essays, case studies, and research reports, designed to improve the English language and communications skills of graduates, may have been compromised. This may contribute to the fact that many employers of graduates are concerned about the low levels of English language and communication skills displayed by accounting graduates, particularly international student.

ABSTRACT: Internationalization has become a sort of mantra in higher education. European universities strive to foster the internationalization process in which English as the current lingua franca and English-medium instruction play a paramount role. This paper examines the effect of internationalization on language policies and the degree of freedom universities enjoy when it comes to making their own decisions. The analysis is carried out at four different levels: the macro level (European institutions’ initiatives), the meso level (at the state level), the micro level (at university level) and the nano level (personified by the university stakeholders). Taking Spolsky’s (2004) language policy definition as a framework, the example of one particular multilingual higher education institution, namely the University of the Basque Country in Spain, will be under scrutiny in order to examine the impact of language policy and its three main components (language ideologies, language practices and language management) on the different university bodies. © 2015 European Journal of Applied Linguistics.

ABSTRACT: Reflecting the level of priority currently attributed to public university financing in ongoing discussions, the objective of this article is to debate alternative forms of attracting resources from stakeholders not normally associated with the financing of public universities. We begin by detailing sources of university financing as it slowly migrates from the public sector to the market. After we move on to describe the main public university stakeholders and the respective relationships between the parties. Finally, our discussion focuses on different means and alternatives ways, to finance public universities through use of non-traditional stakeholders giving some examples. In conclusions we find that despite university managers normally being aware of such entities, the other internal university actors show a lack of pro-activeness regarding the opportunities presented by different stakeholders. So the public universities need to actively engage with the marketplace, and this reality can be achieved if at internal level they are assigned priorities for the relationships with these new stakeholders. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

ABSTRACT: This article classifies and assigns degrees of influence to the stakeholders involved in the implementation of strategic planning at a Brazilian higher education institution. In order to test the stakeholder influence theory, we carried out a case study of a Brazilian university based on qualitative methods. The models of Frooman (Academy of Management Review, 24(2), 191–205, 1999) and Mitchell et al. (Academy of Management Review, 22(4), 853–886, 1997) served as the theoretical basis for assessing the stakeholders’ identification and management. Findings indicate that higher education institutions focus on the internal and external stakeholders that have the power to control them. In practice, this study provides insight into the stakeholder influences that have an effect on the implementation of strategic planning in a university. Based on the findings, university managers will be able to think more strategically about the institution’s objectives, taking into account the degree of influence that stakeholders have on the institution’s objectives. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this article is to offer insight to administrators and human resource professionals at Traditionally White Institutions (TWIs) about developing action plans that provide meaningful support to Black administrators and faculty who are coping with racial trauma. Operationalizing tenets of Critical Race Methodology (CRM), the counter-narratives presented here are drawn from 15 years of unpublished professional and personal communication created by an individual Black faculty and administrator. The lectures, conference presentations, commencement addresses and other ephemera trace the development of battlements and emotional battle scars over the early years of one scholar-activist’s career at TWIs. The calamitous aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is considered in this context both as metaphor and collective psychic wound. As such, it illuminates other instances of vicarious trauma, foreshadows the Movement for Black Lives, and provides a devastating illustration of administrative unpreparedness. Revealing the ramifications of racial trauma can serve to help others who suffer to feel less alone and can provide stakeholders in higher education with valuable knowledge for the sake not only of recruitment and retention, but institutional transformation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Concerns about the quality of higher education are currently monopolising the national policy agenda. The notion of quality is being viewed in a variety of ways, but two main approaches may be discerned. One approach uses “quality” to focus rather narrowly on performance, control and simple outcome measures. The other involves a broader, more comprehensive approach that accommodates more adequately the rich complexity and intangibility of higher education’s processes and outcomes. This paper explores the views embodied in recent statements by higher education stakeholders about quality in higher education, employing as a framework two basic approaches to quality which have been termed the “production-measurement” and the “stakeholder-judgement” views. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Involving external stakeholders in project courses

ABSTRACT: Problem: The involvement of external stakeholders in capstone projects and project courses is desirable due to its potential positive effects on the students. Capstone projects particularly profit from the inclusion of an industrial partner to make the project relevant and help students acquire professional skills. In addition, an increasing push towards education that is aligned with industry and incorporates industrial partners can be observed. However, the involvement of external stakeholders in teaching moments can create friction and could, in the worst case, lead to frustration of all involved parties. Contribution: We developed a model that allows analysing the involvement of external stakeholders in university courses both in a retrospective fashion, to gain insights from past course instances, and in a constructive fashion, to plan the involvement of external stakeholders. Key Concepts: The conceptual model and the accompanying guideline guide the teachers in their analysis of stakeholder involvement. The model is comprised of several activities (define, execute, and evaluate the collaboration). The guideline provides questions that the teachers should answer for each of these activities. In the constructive use, the model allows teachers to define an action plan based on an analysis of potential stakeholders and the pedagogical objectives. In the retrospective use, the model allows teachers to identify issues that appeared during the project and their underlying causes. Drawing from ideas of the reflective practitioner, the model contains an emphasis on reflection and interpretation of the observations made by the teacher and other groups involved in the courses. Key Lessons: Applying the model retrospectively to a total of eight courses shows that it is possible to reveal hitherto implicit risks and assumptions and to gain a better insight into the interaction between external stakeholders and students. Our empirical data reveals seven recurring risk themes that categorise the different risks appearing in the analysed courses. These themes can also be used to categorise mitigation strategies to address these risks proactively. Additionally, aspects not related to external stakeholders, e.g., about the interaction of the project with other courses in the study programme, have been revealed. The constructive use of the model for one course has proved helpful in identifying action alternatives and finally deciding to not include external stakeholders in the project due to the perceived cost-benefit-ratio. Implications to Practice: Our evaluation shows that the model is a viable and useful tool that allows teachers to reason about and plan the involvement of external stakeholders in a variety of course settings, and in particular in capstone projects. © 2018 ACM.

ABSTRACT: What value does the university offer in terms of economic and social development? Having stakeholders question the contribution and value of colleges and universities is not new nor is it unique to American universities. Institutions of higher education are currently facing a crisis of confidence by parents, prospective students, alumni, congressional committees, and the media. Many stakeholders are concerned about the value provided by colleges and universities. Although there has been an effort to call attention to the issue and to examine select educational processes, there is a dire need to address all aspects of the university product. This article provides a market-based paradigm to help university/college administrators understand the critical aspects of identifying, defining, managing, and delivering superior value to all stakeholders of the institution. This article also provides a university planning process model for incorporating value in the strategic planning process of any university. Faced with increasing pressure to reduce the churn rate of students and increase retention, universities' focus must shift toward attracting students who fit with the value proposition (delivery) of the institution. This article is not an attempt at resolving the debate over the role or purpose of the university; our intent is to present a market-based approach to facilitate the delivery of value to all university stakeholders in keeping with the vision and mission of the institution. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This paper aims to demonstrate the need for universities to include information on intellectual capital in their accounting information system. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was conducted to discover the extent to which the different users of university accounting information are now demanding information concerning intellectual capital in order to make the right decisions. To this end a questionnaire was designed and sent to all the members of the Social Councils of Spain's public universities. Findings: The findings show the opinion of university accounting information users regarding the need for universities to publish information on their intellectual capital in order to make the current model of university accounting information more relevant. Practical implications: The results of this research show the intangible elements about which universities should provide information in order to satisfy their users' new information demands. Originality/value: No previous research in this area has been conducted for Spanish universities. This paper brings new expertise regarding the traditional information supplied by universities, which needs to be extended to include information on intellectual capital. Giving users access to a type of information that is relevant for good decision-making constitutes a healthy exercise in transparency for universities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents an evidence-based model (the I3E model) for embedding education for sustainability (EfS) within a higher education institution. This model emerged from a doctoral research that examined organisational learning and change processes at the University of Southampton to build EfS into the university curriculum. The researcher aimed to learn from real practice through acting as a facilitator for curriculum development in EfS within an interdisciplinary group of academic staff members. A critical friend position was also acquired within a community of practice to implement a programme which attempted to embed sustainability within the student experience. The I3E model identifies four overarching components that can support universities in their aim to embed EfS within the undergraduate curriculum. These integrated components are: Inform the university community about sustainability; Engage the different university stakeholders in the change process towards sustainability; Empower individuals and groups to make change happen within their sphere of influence and action; and Embed sustainability within existing university structures. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: A varied set of major stakeholders in higher education results in diverse perspectives on what entails quality in online higher education. Learners, employers, accreditation agencies, funding and regulatory authorities, and higher education institutions exist for different purposes. Yet, all have a common interest in the success of the learners' education. Examining the faculty role in ensuring quality in online higher education, developing a working definition of that role, and identifying considerations for faculty practice that are essential to achieving that end is the purpose of this chapter. The chapter conveys and explains the results of a thematic analysis of the requirements and expectations of the major stakeholders, their contribution toward the formulation of the working definition of the faculty role, their contribution toward the identification of significant considerations for faculty in exercising their role, and makes recommendations for further investigation. © 2017 by IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: With the pressing need for accountability in higher education, standardized outcomes assessments have been widely used to evaluate learning and inform policy. However, the critical question on how scores are influenced by students' motivation has been insufficiently addressed. Using random assignment, we administered a multiple-choice test and an essay across three motivational conditions. Students' self-report motivation was also collected. Motivation significantly predicted test scores. A substantial performance gap emerged between students in different motivational conditions (effect size as large as .68). Depending on the test format and condition, conclusions about college learning gain (i.e., value added) varied dramatically from substantial gain (d = 0.72) to negative gain (d = -0.23). The findings have significant implications for higher education stakeholders at many levels. © 2012 AERA.

ABSTRACT: University research is pivotal for sustainable development, but to succeed, new ways of conducting research are needed. Only recently has the field of "sustainability and higher education" (SHE) started to deal with the issue. In this paper we define "university research for sustainable development" comprehensively as "all research conducted within the institutional context of a university that contributes to sustainable development", and propose a set of twenty two preliminary characteristics of this concept. We provide foundational information in particular for various university stakeholders, and those of higher education in general, considering the (re)orientation of research towards sustainable development and offer a beginning of dialogue on the subject, within SHE. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Higher education for sustainable development (HEfSD) is being significantly shaped by the global sustainability agenda. Many higher education institutions, responsible for equipping the next generation of sustainability leaders with knowledge and essential skills, proactively try to action the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in HEfSD policy, curriculum and practice through scattered and isolated initiatives. Yet, these attempts are not strategically supported by a governing approach to HEfSD or coordinated effectively to tackle social and environmental sustainability. These predicaments not only widen the gap between HEfSD policy, curriculum and practice but also exacerbate the complexities between human and environmental interactions compromising overall sustainability. However, these efforts represent a potential for actioning the Global Agenda for Sustainable Development. Based on a qualitative research strategy, theory building methodology and various methodological techniques (surveys, policy and literature review, group and individual interviews), this research suggests that the advancement of HEfSD in policy, curriculum and practice depends largely on a better understanding of existing gaps, target areas, commonalities and differences across regional HEfSD agendas. This will hopefully provide higher education institutions and their stakeholders across regions with some conceptual and practical tools to consider strategically how HEfSD can successfully be integrated into policy, curriculum and practice in alignment with SDGs and with the overall mandate of the Global Agenda for Sustainable Development. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Student success, variously understood as engagement, persistence, completion, graduation and entry to employment, has become a central focus for stakeholders in higher education. Theoretical and empirical research exploring these varied conceptions has mushroomed since the 1980s. Much of this literature focuses on what and how higher education institutions contribute to student success; a substantial amount also reports on the part students play in their own success. Less frequently studies investigate how non-institutional influences affect student success. This article addresses this gap. It uses data from a survey of first-time enrolled students in New Zealand higher education to investigate the importance of family, cultural, employment and personal influences on student perceptions of success. Findings show that non-institutional influences exert a moderate effect on student success, and that they are influences which need to be considered by institutions interested in fostering student success. © 2011 Society for Research into Higher Education.

ABSTRACT: The reporting of intellectual capital in higher education institutions becomes of vital importance mainly due to the fact that knowledge is the main output and input in these institutions. Also, the increasing social concern about establishing procedures of accountability and ensuring information transparency in public universities prompted us to raise the need to disclose information on their intellectual capital. This paper aims to know the main reasons why Spanish universities do not disclose information about their intellectual capital in the current accounting information model and the positive consequences that may result from such disclosure. To this end a questionnaire was designed and sent to all the members of the Social Councils of Spanish public universities. The obtained results show that intellectual capital disclosure results in a higher transparency of the institution, increased user satisfaction and improved credibility, image and reputation of the University, while it is the lack of internal systems of identification and measurement of intangible elements the main reason for not disclosing information on intellectual capital. © 2012 ASEPUC.

ABSTRACT: This study aims to investigate the perceptual differences in core competencies of tourism graduates between the main stakeholders in higher education; namely, industry practitioners and students in Korea employing Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results show that both groups emphasize core competencies in common, including a considerate attitude, communication ability, integrated thinking ability, language ability, and a goal-orientated disposition. However, there are different perceptions regarding the relative importance among competencies. The results reflect insights into the amount of consideration that needs to be given to bolster competency-based tourism education in an effort to prepare students in developing both job-specific and generic skills. © 2017

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is threefold: first, to know the views of university stakeholders concerning intellectual capital (IC) reporting; second, to examine the quality of voluntary IC disclosure by public Spanish universities on their websites; and third, to analyze some of the potential factors affecting this kind of disclosure. Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies a content analysis and a survey. The content analysis was used to analyze the websites of 50 public Spanish universities in the year 2016, while the survey was submitted to all members of the Social Councils of Spanish public universities. Also, a regression analysis (ordinary least square model) is conducted to relate the disclosure index to its determinants. Findings: The results of this study show that human capital was the most disclosed category with relational capital being the least frequently disclosed. However, the quality of structural capital disclosures was higher than relational and human capital. Moreover, the results show that size and university’s internationality affect IC disclosure in Spanish public universities. Practical implications: This paper stimulates the debate between universities and policy-makers concerning the benefits related to IC reporting as a tool for addressing different stakeholders’ needs. In order to satisfy the information needs of university stakeholders, Spanish universities can be recommended to focus on reporting higher quality information on financial relations, students’ satisfaction, quality standard, work-related knowledge/know-how and collaboration between universities and other organizations such as firms, local government and society as a whole. Originality/value: This research brings new expertise regarding IC disclosure in higher education and to reveal some of the possible determinants to improve this disclosure. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This article reports a mixed-method study that explored higher education stakeholders’ perceptions of the causes of Vietnamese graduates’ skills gap. Email interviews with 38 stakeholders and a survey with the participation of 475 final-year students, graduates, academics, and employers revealed 27 factors perceived to have caused the skills gap. Among them, factors related to impractical university curriculum, constant changes in the labor market, and students’ passivity in planning and developing their career were perceived to be the most influential. The study also revealed that stakeholder groups were blaming each other for who should be responsible for the skills gap. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Universities worldwide are starting to turn to cloud computing. The quality characteristics, which include access to a wider network of computing resources, pay-as-you-go services, self-services, agile services, and resource centralisation provide a convincing argument for HEIs to adopt cloud services. However, the risks leading to non-adoption range from security issues to a lack of cloud vendor support. The findings suggest that security, privacy, and trust are the key determinants to non-adoption as stakeholders felt that the cloud cannot fully guarantee the safeguarding of sensitive information. Key determinants to cloud adoption include improving relationships between students and teachers via collaborative tools and proposing cloud apps for mobile devices for accessing virtual learning materials and email securely off-campus. In conclusion, university stakeholders are still unconvinced about adopting cloud services, but future advances of the cloud may help to steer their decision to adopt this innovative technology given its overwhelming potential. © 2021, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a model for recognition and measurement of intellectual capital (IC) in Spanish universities. Design/methodology/approach: In this study the authors developed a questionnaire which was sent to members of the social councils of Spanish public universities in order to identify which intangible elements university stakeholders demand most. The study results served as a basis to develop a model of IC measurement for Spanish universities. Findings -The results of the empirical study are used to identify which intangible elements need to be measured and to define a battery of indicators. Practical implications: This paper aims to provide a set of IC indicators to help universities on the path to presenting useful information to their stakeholders, contributing to a greater transparency, accountability and comparability in the higher education sector. Originality/value - Although the scientific and professional literature has provided numerous proposals for measuring and reporting a firm's IC, further research is still needed since there are few empirically supported models for the measurement and reporting of IC in universities. This need is especially relevant when considering empirical supported IC models. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: A decade has elapsed since the Learning Management System (LMS) technology permeated its way into higher education in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), offering new paradigms of both blended and online mode e-learning delivery. Parallel to other continents, the introduction of LMS stimulated acceptance and adoption intentions among stakeholders in higher education. This necessitated research into faculty members' and students' LMS acceptance and adoption intentions. While some research has been conducted in this dimension, the evidential facts are scattered. There is a need to agglomerate these studies to project a better picture of study patterns and results, to be abreast of the current state of the literature and better direct future research. This study sought to bridge the gap by way of a systematic review of previous studies within a decade of LMS acceptance research in SSA, placing them in contextual paradigms of models, methodologies, milestones, subjects, countries, findings and challenges. Results from a systematic review of 31 studies, revealed key determinants of LMS acceptance/adoption to be Attitude and Perceived Usefulness; followed by Performance Expectancy and Perceived Ease of Use; then lastly Social Influence. Major challenges to LMS implementation identified were ICT infrastructure; LMS usage skills and training; LMS system quality, LMS use policy and management support. TAM1 was the dominant model employed and students were the main subject of studies. Moreover, quantitative approach was the preferred design with Regression as the main statistical tool used for data analysis. The study recommended among others that more UTAUT or TAM3 based studies employing mixed method design with instructors as subjects, using structural equation modelling analysis are needed in SSA LMS research. Leadership and top management of higher education institutions should focus more on ICT infrastructure, LMS usage skills/training, LMS quality related issues, support and ICT policy formulation. © Authors.

Discourses on quality and quality assurance in higher education from the perspective of global university rankings

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This paper aims to investigate how global university rankings interact with quality and quality assurance in higher education along the two lines of investigation, that is, from the perspective of their relationship with the concept of quality (assurance) and the development of quality assurance policies in higher education, with particular emphasis on accreditation as the prevalent quality assurance approach. Design/methodology/approach: The paper firstly conceptualises quality and quality assurance in higher education and critically examines the methodological construction of the four selected world university rankings and their references to “quality”. On this basis, it answers the two “how” questions: How is the concept of quality (assurance) in higher education perceived by world university rankings and how do they interact with quality assurance and accreditation policies in higher education? Answers are provided through the analysis of different documentary sources, such as academic literature, glossaries, international studies, institutional strategies and other documents, with particular focus on official websites of international ranking systems and individual higher education institutions, media announcements, and so on. Findings: The paper argues that given their quantitative orientation, it is quite problematic to perceive world university rankings as a means of assessing or assuring the institutional quality. Like (international) accreditations, they may foster vertical differentiation of higher education systems and institutions. Because of their predominant accountability purpose, they cannot encourage improvements in the quality of higher education institutions. Practical implications: Research results are beneficial to different higher education stakeholders (e.g. policymakers, institutional leadership, academics and students), as they offer them a comprehensive view on rankings’ ability to assess, assure or improve the quality in higher education. Originality/value: The existing research focuses principally either on interactions of global university rankings with the concept of quality or with processes of quality assurance in higher education. The comprehensive and detailed analysis of their relationship with both concepts thus adds value to the prevailing scholarly debates. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: University rankings as developed by the media are used by many stakeholders in higher education: students looking for university places; academics looking for university jobs; university managers who need to maintain standing in the competitive arena of student recruitment; and governments who want to know that public funds spent on universities are delivering a world class higher education system. Media rankings deliberately draw attention to the performance of each university relative to all others, and as such they are undeniably simple to use and interpret. But one danger is that they are potentially open to manipulation and gaming because many of the measures underlying the rankings are under the control of the institutions themselves. This paper examines media rankings (constructed from an amalgamation of variables representing performance across numerous dimensions) to reveal the problems with using a composite index to reflect overall performance. It ends with a proposal for an alternative methodology which leads to groupings rather than point estimates. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

ABSTRACT: Increased marketisation and competition has renewed interest in how universities can partner, or co-create, with students. To address this, and further conceptualise a model of co-creation across inputs, processes, and outcomes, this article summarises the findings from 10 different case studies of student-staff co-creation (e.g., co-producers of learning resources, peer mentors, co-creators of the curriculum) in the Australasian higher education context. Our data include qualitative survey responses (n= 97) and interviews (n= 35) with students and staff. Based on these data, we present an evidence-informed model of co-creation that elucidates the key considerations in the co-creation process. The model highlights and distinguishes two dual-value creation dimensions that underlie co-creation, co-production, and value-in-use. The result is a model of co-creation in higher education that can help guide administrators, researchers, and higher education stakeholders to better conceptualise, design, implement, and assess co-creation activities. © 2019 Association for Tertiary Education Management and the LH Martin Institute for Tertiary Education Leadership and Management.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent and quality of online intellectual capital (IC) disclosure released via websites and social media in relation to university stakeholders’ information needs in Spanish public universities. In addition, this paper examines whether there are differences in the online IC disclosure according to the type of university. Design/methodology/approach: The study applies content analysis and a survey. The content analysis was used to analyse the websites and social media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram) of all Spanish public universities in the year 2019, whereas the survey was submitted to all members of the Social Councils of Spanish public universities. Findings: The findings indicate that university stakeholders attach great importance to online disclosure of specific information about IC. However, the findings emphasise that Spanish universities’ website and social media content are still in their infancy. Specifically, this study found that the quality of disclosed information on IC in public universities’ websites is of low level, particularly with regard to the disclosure of relational capital. The study found that the information provided by Spanish public universities via social media mainly concerns the structural and relational capital. Likewise, the results of this paper evidence that the larger and more internationally focused universities reveal more online information on IC. Practical implications: The results of the research may be beneficial for managers of higher education institutions as a basis for developing adequate strategies addressing IC disclosure through the websites. In order to satisfy the information needs of university stakeholders, Spanish universities can be recommended to focus on reporting higher-quality information on financial relations, students’ satisfaction, quality standard, work-related knowledge/know-how and collaboration between universities and other organisations such as firms, local government and society as a whole. Originality/value: This study explores two innovative tools to provide IC disclosure in the higher education institutions context, namely, websites and social media, whereas previous studies focused on traditional tools as annual report. Likewise, this study considers the quality of this information. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Since the launch of the Lisbon Agenda, European higher education systems have gravitated towards a common policy blueprint for governance that concentrates power in the hands of executive authorities and increases accountability to external stakeholders. The Polish system remains an outlier, providing an informative case study of a clash between European pressures and local path dependencies. The objective of this study was to investigate the forces that lodge the Polish system of higher education between the market and academic oligarchy, utilizing the lens of Burton Clark’s (1986. The Higher Education System: Academic Organization in Cross-national Perspective. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press) typology of governance. The author sought to uncover and compare the conceptualizations of governance held by two most powerful groups of higher education stakeholders. Findings indicate a stalemate of values between accountability to public interest and the independence of the academic order from short-term political interests. Conclusions from this study can inform reform efforts in contexts where externally legitimated blueprints for reform in higher education converge with social realities belying the blueprints’ inherent assumptions. © 2018, © 2018 Society for Research into Higher Education.

ABSTRACT: A study was undertaken in four Tanzanian universities to investigate the status and practice of information literacy (IL) so as to determine the best ways of introducing or improving IL programmes. This article reports on the findings related to challenges and opportunities that could influence the effective implementation and introduction of IL programmes in Tanzanian universities. Data for the study was collected using a questionnaire-based survey administered to teaching staff, librarians and undergraduate students. Semi-structured interviews collected data from Deputy Vice Chancellors (DVCs) for academic affairs, Faculty Deans, Library Directors and a Library Head. The findings of the study showed that IL was new in the university curricula although some IL rubrics were being practised. Lack of adequate resources, lack of an IL policy, lack of proactive solutions among librarians coupled with the need for adequate library staffing and training, and collaboration between librarians and teaching staff in IL activities were all identified as challenges facing IL effectiveness. Also identified were potential opportunities such as the support by the majority of university stakeholders to mainstream IL and make it a compulsory course. These opportunities would allow the introduction of effective and sustainable IL programmes. The article concludes that librarians should seize the opportunities that are available to spearhead IL while at the same time making sure they tackle the identified challenges.

ABSTRACT: Purpose – This paper aims to provide a better understanding of the relationship between intellectual capital (IC) reporting and transparency in Spanish universities. The purpose of this paper is to obtain new empirical findings and an enhanced understanding of the role of IC in an organizational change process is obtained. Design/methodology/approach – In this study the authors developed a questionnaire which was sent to members of the Social Councils of Spanish public universities in order to analyse the views of university stakeholders in relation to the university’s annual reports and the adequacy and potential of IC reporting to meet their information needs. Findings – From the results of this study the authors are in the position of confirming the need for universities to offer information on IC in their accounting information model. Practical implications – All these results lead us to assert that to improve the information contained in the current university annual reports, it is necessary to make accounting regulators aware of the need to extend the information provided in the current accounting statements. Giving users access to a type of information relevant for good decision making constitutes a healthy exercise in transparency for universities. Originality/value – Although the scientific and professional literature has provided numerous studies about reporting a firm’s IC, further research is still needed for universities. This need is especially relevant when considering empirical supported IC models. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: The interactions of users in social networks have been analyzed in the literature as sources of information on their ability to generate engagement among stakeholders in higher education institutes, which make more tactical than strategic use of social networks. This study helps identify which variables generate greater participation in Instagram users, providing strategic proposals for digital marketing. From the codification of all the publications published by a university in a social network site during the period of one year, a comparative analysis was carried out through a multivariate model. The results provide important and timely implications for both universities and higher education professionals. Our findings suggest that higher education marketing specialists should develop stronger and more consistent communication strategies to establish more valuable relationships with stakeholders. The administrators of the social networks of higher education institutions can find patterns in those publications that generate a greater participation in this study. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: In this article, a higher education institution (HEI) is analysed as an organisation performing under change conditions. In this context, needs and expectations of a wide range of university stakeholders are analysed. The aim of this article is to indicate the roles of stakeholders leading to the development of an HEI. Although Ishikawa's cause-and-effect diagram is used when identifying possible causes of a problem, it can also be seen as a method that allows splitting the subject into separate parts, which are causally interrelated. During the research of the activity fields of the HEI and the boundaries related to its surrounding groups, the connections between different groups, their interests and expectations towards the activities of the HEI were determined. The article is prepared using the theoretical-analytical approach. It contains the analysis of the literature on HEI stakeholders, quality management systems and issues concerning the organisational development. The conclusions include insights and suggestions for further research on the ways an HEI can correspond to the needs of stakeholders. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd. ter Bevordering der Pharmacie (KNMP).

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039752451&doi=10.1108%2fJIC-03-2017-0050&partnerID=40&md5=77d8c2d17d15de1dbc536d6551d6c8db

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss academic spinoffs (ASO) as an expression of the value creation of university technology transfer (TT) investments. More recently, scholars have emphasised intellectual capital’s (IC) importance, also for universities in obtaining competitive advantages and by creating value. Such spinoffs are key to regional development, as a primary aspect of universities’ IC. Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the aim through a sample of the University of Pisa’s spinoffs. The authors measured the value the university’s third mission investment generates on the area by means of entrepreneurship through two different approaches. First, the authors defined a multiplier of the TT investment (university TT multiplier) and then explored the IC components’ contributions to the ASOs’ enterprise value (EV). Findings: The results show that the University of Pisa’s TT investments positively impact the local community through the spinoff system, both in economic terms and in IC. In the long term, these investments can enrich scientific humus and entrepreneurial mindsets. Research limitations/implications: This is an exploratory study of the University of Pisa’s impacts on the local economy. The results are limited to the context of Pisa and to the TT policy. Another limitation is the subjectivity of the EV estimation. Practical implications: The results can have some practical implications. The large portfolio of university stakeholders (policymakers, families, students, companies, financiers, etc.) ask for information, especially on long-term results: in a simple way, the multiplier is able to communicate important feedbacks to support their decision-making process. Social implications: With the multiplier, the authors give a tool to measure the social enrichment. Originality/value: In the study, the authors propose a new tool to measure the impact of the investment in TT on the local community. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This study focused on university social responsibility (USR). Corporate social responsibility is currently an extremely common strategy implemented by organizations. Higher education institutions are also introducing this strategy to enhance their performance, seeking to ensure that every university action is socially responsible and oriented toward achieving advantages over competitors. This competitive advantage is the result of a social responsibility vision, which has an ethical core, that the University has implemented or is implementing among all its stakeholders. These institutions work in four areas: instruction, research, management, and projection to society. Universities must thus strive to meet the interests of different stakeholders' interests. This research concentrated on university students as an important stakeholder. The main objective was to evaluate university students' participation in USR activities, as well as assessing the impact of relevant university practices. In addition, the study sought to measure the existing causal relationship between students' participation and their university's practices in terms of student satisfaction. The fieldwork was conducted with an electronic survey distributed to a group of University of Extremadura students in Spain. A total of 362 valid questionnaires were collected, which were processed using structural equation modeling and partial least squares. The results have implications for university management in the area of social responsibility, with regard to the new USR trends are revealed. In terms of originality and value, this research emphasized a specific stakeholder in universities, namely students, and ways their satisfaction can be achieved through USR. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Higher education institutions are under pressure to produce employable graduates who are required to contribute to the sustainability of strong economic growth and development. As such, the onus is on the higher education sector to present graduates to the labour market who are both work ready and have attained employability. This article contributes to the discussion surrounding the employability of graduates by: enhancing understanding and discussing contemporary evidence and debate around employability; showing the genesis, influence and synthesis of the major models associated with employability; summarising the boundaries and barriers to graduate employment; and exploring the determinants of employability from the employer’s perspective. Importantly, the article summarises the contemporary theoretical bases of employability in the one place. Recommendations are made regarding further research and the need for further theoretical contributions. © 2017 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of service quality on graduates’ satisfaction as perceived by Middle East University (MEU) graduates. Design/methodology/approach: This research is cross-sectional and aims to explore the effect of service quality dimensions (academic staff, administration, classrooms and library services) on graduates’ satisfaction. Data were collected from 399 graduates. After confirming validity, reliability and normality of the data, and the correlation between variables, multiple regressions were used to test the hypothesis. Findings: The results show that all service quality dimensions are highly implemented by the MEU. The relationships between all service quality dimensions and graduates’ satisfaction are strong. Finally, results show that all service quality dimensions affect graduates’ satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: To generalize the results of this research, further studies are recommended to be carried out on other universities especially in Jordan. Testing the perception and satisfaction of other universities, stakeholders will help to improve service quality and to gain suitable competitive strategies. Practical implications: Service quality is a key driver for universities’ sustainable competitive advantage; therefore, dimensions of service quality should be included within universities plan, strategies and daily activities. Social implications: Considering service quality in higher education improves countries’ economic development, quality of life and well-being. All corporate social responsibility pillars (social, economic, environmental responsibilities and national and international regulation and norms) should be adapted and adopted within services quality systems and programs. Originality/value: Most of previous studies were carried out to test the students’ perception while this research is dedicated to explore graduates’ perception regarding service quality offered by the MEU. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Universities play a key role in the development of society, and their involvement in sustainable development will be crucial in changing current practices in society towards sustainable development. Thus, information about the measures and actions taken towards sustainable development needs to be communicated to all university stakeholders. Sustainability reporting is a voluntary tool for disclosing efforts towards sustainable development, but little research has analysed the diffusion of sustainability reporting among universities. This study uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to explain the worldwide diffusion of sustainability reporting in universities. At the macro level, regressions using logistic curves showed the stage of diffusion regarding sustainability reporting for different regions around the world. At the micro level, two types of data were analysed to assess the sustainable practices used among universities: (i) data from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting database and (ii) sustainability reports from the GRI database. The results indicate that the diffusion of sustainability reporting is still at an early stage in universities, and no massive diffusion is expected based on the current data, despite the increasing concerns about sustainability in young people and other university stakeholders. Some actions need to be taken to persuade universities to adopt reporting standards and to highlight the benefits and necessity of sustainability reporting. Some European universities, which are the most active universities in providing sustainability reports, have improved their visibility by adopting the GRI, thus increasing their endowments and facilitating their ability to raise funds for future sustainability activities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The increasing rate of globalisation is having a marked influence on education. Internationalisation has developed in response to these changes. This study explores the progression of internationalisation strategies in higher educational institutions in the Kingdom of Bahrain. A quantitative methodology was adopted whereby data was collected to measure academics' perceptions regarding the strategy factors and implementation processes in their institutions. Qualitative methods were used during interviews with key stakeholders in higher education. The findings identified several factors that were perceived to influence the effective implementation of internationalisation strategies. They also highlighted a gap between strategy and implementation practices which exists in higher education institutions. Academic staff members did not always agree that their institutions were committed to achieving the goals of their internationalisation strategies. It is recommended that a national internationalisation framework be developed underpinned by clear policies and procedures that lead to the effective implementation of internationalisation strategies.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This paper aims to develop a new model of stakeholder classification and a model for explaining the relationship between the organization and its respective stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: The new proposed model is based on an empirical study that comprises an exploratory study based on 15 interviews and a confirmatory study based on 684 questionnaires answered by staff of 11 public universities. The main variable deployed is the stakeholder's respective level of influence from the organization's management perspective, that is, their level of legitimacy, power and urgency. Findings: The new model proposes six stakeholder types (regulator, controller, partner, passive, dependent and non-stakeholder). To explain the relationship between the stakeholder and the organization, the traditional needs-satisfaction vision was expanded. The variables of relevance, mutual influence and participation were found to be important in explaining the organization and stakeholder relationship. This study contributes both in simplifying stakeholder classification and in explaining the relationships between parties. Research limitations/implications: The study proposes a new model for stakeholder classification based on empirical research carried out with public organizations, therefore it is advisable to test this new classification scheme with other types of organizations. Originality/value: This research proposes a stakeholder classification scheme previously unpublished in the literature, which helps organizations managing the relationships with their stakeholders. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: The pivotal role of Entrepreneurship centers in the development of Entrepreneurship Education (EE) is receiving more attention. This study aims to open the "black box" of "how, when, why and what" entrepreneurial mindset and competencies in the field of technology entrepreneurship are learned over time in the Entrepreneurship Centers. The study adopts an empirical web-based content analysis of ten entrepreneurship centers in European Universities from seven countries, analyzing 105 curricular and extra-curricular entrepreneurship education programs. This method allows researchers to address generalization bias and to effectuate a cross-case comparison, thus revealing more common patterns regarding the phenomenon. Findings reveal some common pillars of EE as developed within the Entrepreneurship centers in terms of five key dimensions: target audience, learning objectives, entrepreneurship contents, learning pedagogies and stakeholders' engagement. This analysis provides the basis to introduce a process-based framework for entrepreneurial mindset creation in EE that is organized around four main phases: inspiration, engagement, exploitation and sustainment. The process-based model of EE supports entrepreneurship centers in designing learning initiatives that are aimed to inspire students at all levels of education, young entrepreneurs and start-uppers and scientists in their need to be equipped with an entrepreneurial mindset for technology entrepreneurship. The originality of the paper stands on the "process-based" framework that is proposed that serves as an interactive pathway that dynamically combines the phases toward entrepreneurial venture creation, the entrepreneurial competence level, the entrepreneurial learning strategies and collaboration with the University's stakeholders' network toward the achievement of the competence goal. © 2018 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Critical-thinking scholarship is in a mystified state. No single definition of critical thinking is widely accepted, but stakeholders in higher education often enter conversation about critical thinking with the premise that their individual definitions are uniformly shared. With an increasing emphasis on academic accountability, we need to work toward a better understanding of the varying ways the term critical thinking is used and explore the implications of the variation for effective pedagogy. In this article, I describe the confusion about critical thinking in psychology and offer suggestions for demystifying the concept. I provide a framework for organizing critical-thinking scholarship into meaningful dimensions. Finally, I describe a psychology curriculum using performance-based assessment practices as one context in which critical thinking in psychology can be made clearer for students and faculty. © 1995, SAGE Publications.

ABSTRACT: For the past forty years, United States school districts have increasingly hired mathematics specialists to support the teaching and learning of mathematics. Despite the prevalence of this professional development structure, this is a relatively new research topic for the mathematics education field. In this paper, we report findings from an exploration of literature between 1981 and 2018 to examine the role of mathematics specialists (MSs). In particular, we examine: (a) MS positioning across research; (b) historical trends of school-based MS research; and (c) orientations of school-based MSs within research. Using the McGatha and Rigelman framework as an analytic lens, we found that beyond the positions identified in their framework (coach, intervention specialist, teacher), there were four additional MS positionings within the research (learner, other p-12 stakeholder, university stakeholder, unknown). Ultimately, we forward an expansion to the McGatha and Rigelman framework to include these new categories, as well as contextual descriptions and working definitions to support future research in more accurately and robustly capturing the ways in which MSs are investigated and reported on in research. © 2021 The Authors.

University technology transfer: Network bridge promotion by the Medici Fellowship Scheme
(2007) Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 14 (3), pp. 360 - 384, Cited 12 times.

ABSTRACT: Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore whether the Medici Fellowship Scheme addressed attitudinal and resource barriers to the commercialisation of knowledge within five research-intensive universities. The following research questions were explored: Did the Medici fellows change the attitudes of academic network members in host departments towards the commercialisation of research? Did the Medici Fellowship Scheme encourage fellows to accumulate human and social capital? Did the Medici Fellowship Scheme encourage fellows to leverage their academic and practitioner networks? Design/methodology/approach The scheme was implemented in Biomedical departments across five universities located in the Midlands in England. Six months after the completion of the scheme information was consistently gathered from six Medici fellows, six technology transfer officers (TTOs) and six senior academics. Face-to-face interviews were conducted. Information was gathered through structured and semi-structured open-ended questions. Findings Fellows who accumulated human and social capital were able to act as agents of attitudinal change in their host departments. The fellows did not markedly change the culture towards commercialization, but they addressed several structural holes by building network bridges with actors positioned in practitioner networks. They created new weak ties with external actors who provided early stage funding, market and legal information and potential customers. Fellows also strengthened existing ties within academic networks both inter and intra university. The career destinations of the fellows after the scheme helped sustain bridging behaviour by providing points of contact for their peers and/or by demonstrating the viability of alternative sources of funding and prestige for academics. Practical implications Despite a widely perceived successful scheme, structural holes were still apparent in the monitored departments. Additional bridges need to be built between academic networks and actors, such as surrogate entrepreneurs and private equity financiers, to ensure the sustained development of new ventures. Originality/value Guided by insights from human and social capital theory and network theory the outcomes associated with a novel structured training initiative were monitored. Case study evidence was gathered from three types of university stakeholders (i.e. Medici fellows, TTOs and senior academics) involved in the commercialisation process. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The increasing social concern about establishing procedures of accountability and ensuring information transparency in public universities prompted us to raise the need to disclose information on their intellectual capital. Design/methodology/approach: In this study we developed a questionnaire which was sent to members of the Social Councils of Spanish public universities, in order to identify which intangible elements university stakeholders demand most. Findings: The results of this research demonstrate how important it is for Spanish public universities to provide information on their intellectual capital in order to satisfy their stakedolders' information needs. Practical implications: The results of this research lead us to recommend that universities include in their accounting statements the information on intellectual capital demanded by the different stakeholders. Originality/value: No previous research was conducted for Spanish universities. Our results represent a starting point for public universities to identify which is the most requested information about intellectual capital. © Intangible Capital, 2013.

ABSTRACT: A growing emphasis on the discourse of 'student as customer' has increased the salience of the concept of service climate in universities and anecdotal evidence suggests that this may have placed increased pressure on staff. This study investigated the relationship between service climate and psychological well being in a sample of 340 university staff. Questionnaire data was analysed using structural equation modelling showed that a positive service climate was negatively related to job-induced tension and positively related to job satisfaction. Job-induced tension also mediated the effects of service climate on psychological dysfunction and job satisfaction. Implications for management of university stakeholder relationships and directions for future research are discussed. Copyright © eContent Management Pty Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This paper is an attempt to reconcile two different perspectives and come up with a more comprehensive conceptualization of university autonomy by adopting a stakeholder approach in identifying indicators of university autonomy. One perspective views university autonomy as a protection of academic freedom and the other as a performance enhancer. In order to secure public support for university autonomy, a strategy to satisfy both perspectives is required. A stakeholder approach helps identifying stakeholder interests which leads to an analysis of what is expected in return for university autonomy. University autonomy indicators developed out of these interests would facilitate a measure to evaluate and secure academic freedom and institutional autonomy in a way that secures better support for university autonomy from higher education stakeholders. This paper examines existing literature to identify higher education stakeholders and their interests and comes up with an example of autonomy indicators that reflect these interests. © 2018, EAIR - The European Higher Education Society.

Community partners' experiences of higher education service-learning in a community engagement module
(2022) Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education, 14 (1), pp. 394 - 408, Cited 10 times.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this empirical research paper is to investigate the self-perceived role of the community partner of a higher education service-learning and community engagement module. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach was followed by distributing a questionnaire to the community partners of a community engagement module and coding the responses using ATLAS.ti. A total of 36 responses were received from community partners who work with students enrolled in a compulsory undergraduate community-based project module at the University of Pretoria's Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology. Findings: The community partners share a common interest in the students' education. They are experts in their fields and can share their knowledge with the students and the university. Through these partnerships, long-term reciprocal relationships can develop. Community partners can become co-educators and partners in education. The pragmatist representations of community partners can be challenged when they understand their own stakes in service-learning or community engagement projects. This better aids higher education institutes in the management and evaluation of service-learning and community engagement pedagogies and curricula. Research limitations/implications: Two main limitations underlie this study. Firstly, this research is based on data from one community module at a single university. Although a large number of students are registered in the module, the study would be improved by conducting it at more than one university countrywide. Secondly, the study was performed during the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown the country experienced. This was a completely unexpected event for which everyone was totally unprepared. Many of the community partners lacked the resources to receive or respond to an online questionnaire. The nature of the lockdown prevented the researchers from reaching these community partners for a face-to-face interview. The voice of these community partners is, therefore, silent. Practical implications: The community partners reiterated their need to be seen as equal partners in the module and appreciated being part of a group of non-profit enterprises working together with a university to pursue a set of common goals. However, their status as peers depends on their willingness and ability to contribute sufficiently to the structure and demands of the service-learning module. The community partners who were able and willing to orientate each group of students to their organisation's mission and objectives, and who executed their roles according to the course requirements, experienced the greatest success in terms of project effectiveness and efficiency, and also in terms of future benefits when students returned to volunteer or provide donations. Given time, these community partners grew into an equal partner with the university's stakeholders, where both their own needs and those of the students were met during the various service-learning projects. Social implications: Since all respondents in this study are non-profit organisations, the financial assistance and free labour afforded to them by the students are of paramount importance. The community partners also understand the longer-term value implications of successful student projects, as some students return of their free will to volunteer their services when gainfully employed after graduation. Originality/value: Community engagement projects are rarely investigated from the community partner's point of view. This paper elicited their responses and examined them through the lens of Fraser's theory of social justice (Fraser, 2009). © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This study focused on the perspectives of higher education stakeholders on teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL) in online courses in Iran, as well as preservice teachers' learning achievements in online courses. Three cohorts of participants were included in the study: preservice teachers of TEFL (n = 104), TEFL university instructors (n = 23), and heads of TEFL departments (n = 10). Data was collected using a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The Kruskal Wallis test was used to detect differences among participants' perspectives. Preservice teachers' mid-term and final scores in the online courses were also compared. Results show significant differences among the perspectives of the three participant groups regarding online courses. The preservice teachers appeared to have relatively positive attitudes about online learning, while the university instructors and department heads showed lower levels of satisfaction with this medium. Participants identified several challenges in online learning, including lack of rigor in online courses, lack of credibility of course certificates, lack of technological infrastructures, technical problems, lack of practical content in the lessons, lack of human interaction, students' low knowledge of the content, and employers' lack of interest in employing graduates of online courses. Participants also noted the need for pedagogical and technological training for both university instructors and preservice teachers of TEFL. The comparison of preservice teachers' mid-term and final scores in the online courses showed a significant difference and improvement in students' learning achievements with medium to large effect sizes. In the interviews, participants confirmed that online courses could improve student learning. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents the findings of a four-year research project studying change practice and agency in higher education. The main findings of five empirical studies are presented. These findings lay bare how academic staff perceive opportunities to change their practice, identify leaders’ strategies when trying to bring about change, illustrate the different and at times incompatible ways of understanding change initiatives, acknowledge the importance of moral dimensions in change, and demonstrate how leaders mobilise theory when engaging in change practice. The article synthesizes the results of the project and draws conclusions with a view to how academic developers may best engage with critical stakeholders in higher education institutions. The paper concludes by presenting some thoughts on how a new model for academic development may take form. The paper aims to provide insights, inspiration, and critical dialogue to researchers in academic development. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

An investigation of inter-stakeholder dynamics supportive of STEM, community-based learning

ABSTRACT: Community-based learning (CBL) allows universities to leverage educational interactions with various non-university stakeholders. In a STEM context, CBL often includes service-learning, outreach, mentorship programs, pre-college research fairs, and internships where experiential education commonly provides the pedagogical foundation. Such initiatives are predominantly university-centered and the emphasis is on student or programmatic outcomes. This approach limits the potential synergistic benefits of CBL and can minimize the role of, and outcomes for, non-university stakeholders. The study presented here seeks to further knowledge of how inter-stakeholder dynamics can support STEM CBLoutcomes through a qualitative exploration of the interdependencies between stakeholders. Thirty stakeholders from various groups across CBL initiatives organized around a large, public university in South America were interviewed. Interview data was analyzed using a constant comparative method to reveal emergent findings. Findings include characteristics and mechanisms of the relationships that support positive outcomes amongst STEM CBL stakeholders. The findings are structured in three categories: (i) shared purpose; (ii) holistic awareness; and (iii) linked commitment. The empirical findings describing the interdependencies between CBL stakeholders can broaden the current STEM CBL discourse and inform approaches that generate beneficial outcomes for all stakeholders. The extent to which STEM CBL and the supporting relationships are understood in contexts outside the U.S. is limited, a gap in the literature that is addressed through the South American context of this study. Results indicate that an understanding of the interstakeholder dynamics can be leveraged to enhance STEM CBL programs by supporting outcomes for all stakeholders. © z 2019 TEMPUS Publications.

ABSTRACT: This article explores the concept of professionalism in teaching and the facilitation of learning in United Kingdom higher education. Examination of the sociological literature on professionalism and the activities of currently established professional bodies suggest that the control of standards of performance and control of the right to practise are the defining characteristics. A consideration of the present and projected situation in higher education suggests that regulation by a professional body of the right to practise will become increasingly difficult to implement. However, the articulation of professional standards of performance, for an increasingly varied student population, poses a significant challenge for the membership of the newly created Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (the first professional body created in this area), whose results will benefit both the higher education community and the external stakeholders in higher education. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Although the ‘publish-or-perish’ principle has spread globally, many authors believe that it is a negative reinforcer (motivator) and harmful. With this paper, we have tried to help overcome the growing pressure of negative reinforcers on researchers. The paper aimed to propose a model for factors influencing researchers to publish in WoS/Scopus journals, based mainly on positive reinforcement and a combination of concepts including theories of control, management, stakeholders, and psychology. The model was intended for Bulgarian universities. It covered 17 motivational drivers and 29 potential features of internal university stakeholders directly involved in the topic. Factor ranking was not incorporated in the model. The research methodology covered the methods of expert evaluation, analysis/synthesis, induction/deduction, and the toolkit consisted of a comprehensive survey and Kendall’s rank concordance coefficient. The model was implemented at a Bulgarian state university. The empirical study was conducted among 120 researchers. It resulted in factor rankings by university internal stakeholders. The highest-ranked motivational driver was reputation, and the lowest-ranked was the publish-or-perish pressure reducing. The highest-ranked potential features were university prestige and potential and support for promotion. We believe that this model contributes to the theory of behaviour control. The model will also improve university research management by enriching its tools. © 2021 National Research University Higher School of Economics. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The state-university’s interaction and relationship has long been a key focus of scholarly discussion. A distinct strategy in China’s higher education is policy experimentation (PE), which allows indigenous policy innovations to be generated at local institutions and incorporated into national policymaking. The PE approach allows power negotiation among various stakeholders in creating a strategy space for reform. Through case studies, the paper examines those complicated processes enabled and shaped by stakeholders’ perceptions, behaviours and strategic actions. It proposes three types of rationales for using PE as mission-driven, problem-driven and administration-driven. The university uses ‘bargaining and persuasion’ and ‘formation of advocacy coalition’ in negotiating with the state whereas the state communicates with the university through ‘documentary politics’ and ‘open method of coordination’. Thus, PE can be regarded as a new way of HE governance in effectively mediating the state authority and university power in building consensus for China’s HE development. © 2020 Society for Research into Higher Education.

ABSTRACT: Many universities in Indonesia are striving towards becoming internationally renowned universities. Partly, they do so by making English as Medium of Instruction (EMI). The university where the study was conducted commenced EMI through its voluntary EMI programs, which lasted for four years. The discontinuation of the EMI programs was the trigger of this study. This article seeks to understand the stakeholders’ perspectives of EMI. Data were gathered from two focus group interviews involving six content-based lecturers and three policy makers in one state university which utilises EMI approach in their course delivery, and then analysed using thematic and content analysis methods. The findings demonstrate that while the stakeholders agree that mastery of English is important for their university graduates, there was a gap between policy makers’ perspectives and the articulation of the institutional policy concerning the significance of English proficiency in the department’s curriculum. Yet, the stakeholders admit that there is possibility that EMI can be implemented in several relevant departments in the university. The interviews also reveal that stakeholders consider content-based language teaching (CBLT), practised by language specialists, as the most suitable approach should EMI be implemented throughout their university. Finally, this article concludes with further EMI implications for university planning of its English language teaching. © 2018, Association for the teaching of English as a Foreign Language in Indonesia.

ABSTRACT: The BESQoL (Built Environment Sustainability and Quality of Life) Assessment Methodology is a tool for professionals and students associated with the built environment designed to help develop sustainable low carbon developments that provide capabilities for a high quality of life for all members of the community. Developed as a teaching tool for postgraduate students of Oxford Brookes University’s masters programme MSc Sustainable Building: Performance and Design, it has been applied to live built environment developments in the Oxfordshire area of the United Kingdom and in 2014 to two projects in Brazil in collaboration with local universities, stakeholders and professionals. The methodology involves a multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach involving experts from different disciplines and stakeholders associated with the area of development. The methodology includes examining five categories relevant to the development site: (1) the natural environment and natural capital, (2) the built environment, (3) movement, (4) economics, and (5) human capital and quality of life. By enabling a more holistic and informed approach to built environment developments through the application of the BESQoL assessment method, it is argued that students, professionals and local stakeholders (a) begin a transformative learning experience that addresses professional and personal values and can help refocus their professional contribution; (b) begin to understand the scope that needs to be addressed to create sustainable environments and learn to appreciate the relevance and importance of the various disciplines involved; and (c) are better placed to developed holistic and informed strategies that provide sustainable high quality of life solutions for all community members while impacting minimally on the local and global natural environments. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

ABSTRACT: While the number of Asian international students has increased in postsecondary institutions in the United States over the last two decades, unlike their American peers, these students were reported to have more severe mental health issues with less help-seeking intentions and behavior. This study drew the national data collected by American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA) from 2011 to 2014 to examine how various factors were associated with help-seeking intentions and behavior among Asian International Students (AIS) in the U.S. After case-wise deletion of missing data, the dataset used in regression analyses included 97,259 college students, including 2999 AISs, who were randomly drawn within the 62 participated postsecondary institutions. The study performed a series of logistic regression with complex survey design that controlled for institutional clustering effects to analyze the relationship between various factors and AISs’ help-seeking intentions and behavior. The results showed that AIS utilized significantly less services and were less willing to seek mental health services than not only American domestic students but also other international students. Variables related to institutional characteristics, demographic information, academic status, and health conditions were found to significantly influence AISs’ help-seeking intentions and behavior. College mental health professionals and university stakeholders need to pay more attention to the mental health needs of AIS. Implications for college mental health professionals and university stakeholders are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Qatar University is currently at a crossroads, having to respond to competing institutional, national, and international language policy issues. This paper aims to reveal how Qatar University's internal and external stakeholders perceive the future directions of the university's language in education policy. In particular, through Q-methodology, we attempt to uncover social perspectives on three educational language policy options, proposed to the university's higher administration, by the strategic planning team, to respond to pressing linguistic needs and priorities. The aim is to initiate and support a more-informed discussion about language in education policy at Qatar University. Results indicate strong agreement among the various perspectives taken by the university's stakeholders regarding the need for a language in education policy that seeks to manage the relationship between Arabic and English in a parallel way. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Assessment is a central feature of student learning in higher education and has a strong influence on the student experience. Accordingly, the appropriate communication of assessment aims is a priority for all higher education institutions. This study proposes an analytical framework for the interpretation and creation of assessments across higher education disciplines. The framework suggests that assessments can be categorised according to rhetorical purposes, formats, modes and group arrangements. Assessments from three degree programmes at one Australian university are analysed using the framework to show its usefulness in classifying and evaluating task components and generating broad images of degrees based on assessment regimes. We draw on these practical applications to explain and compare discipline-specific qualities of each degree, and argue that the framework might enhance the communication of assessment aims to benefit higher education stakeholders. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: As universities are the change agent of society, institutions from all nations set their goals to transform the world by exploring various societal challenges that humans are facing. Together, the higher education systems across the world developing strategies based on the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The current study aimed to provide policymakers, academics, and researchers an insight on the influence of 16 SDGs on each other paving the way for the universities to set a clear goal in attaining Sustainable Development goals by 2030. To analyze the SDGs’ interactions towards each other, 201,844 research publications from India during five years on 16 SDGs are retrieved from the Scopus database. Spearman Rank Correlation is applied to understand the correlation of each SDG towards one another. We could observe converging results out of the interactions among the SDGs. A significant positive and moderately positive correlation between pairs of SDGs are identified. While a significant number of negative correlations is also classified which need deep thinking among researchers to develop healthy relationships. The most frequent interactions between SDGs is a positive sign for any university in strategizing the goal towards SDGs. The association of all university stakeholders and some constitutional and cultural changes are necessary to put SDGs at the core of the management of the university. Embracing this task by researchers will improve the overall performance of universities. The analysis presented in the present study is useful for academics, governments, funding agencies, researchers, and policy-makers. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This article examines the intents and effects of China’s national policies to promote a synergistic approach to university–industry collaborative education. These policies set out to reduce the academia-industry disconnection for engineering education. Based on document analysis and interviews with various types of stakeholders, the study reveals that China has strived for a synergistic approach to education by strengthening the main-actor role of enterprises, framing a policy support system, incorporating external stakeholders in universities’ governance structures, and building a coordinated framework for a synergistic approach to education. These policies have enhanced enterprises’ motivation to participate in university education, deepened enterprises’ engagement with engineering education at course level, and created an educational innovation ecosystem. Some challenges remain such as the mismatch between course update and technological development, the mismatch between costs and return for faculty members, and difficulty in assessment of outcomes. Overwhelmingly, China has tried exploring a model conducive to the improvement of higher education quality, and the overlapping triple helix model, compared with the statist or laissez-faire patterns, has a more robust effect in galvanizing stakeholders towards their collective goal in the Chinese context. © 2022, Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

ABSTRACT: While higher education institutions play a role in regional sustainability transitions, community–university partnerships for sustainability may be underdeveloped and fraught. Moreover, the specific role of students in building and strengthening those partnerships remains little explored. This research occurred in Laramie, Wyoming—the first community to resolve to pursue carbon neutrality in the top coal-producing state in the U.S.—amidst declining state revenue and absent any formal community–university sustainability partnership. Drawing on a community resilience framework and the social-theoretical construct of agency, we examined an informal, multiyear partnership developed through a project-based, community-engaged Campus Sustainability course at the University of Wyoming. Through a chronological sequence case study, we synthesized autoethnography, document analysis, and semi-structured interview methods involving community and university stakeholder and student participants. We found that students, rather than other university actors, played a vital bridging role in absence of a formal community–university sustainability partnership. They also served in a catalyzing role as change agents alongside community stakeholders, providing the potential to develop stronger community–university partnerships and advance sustainability transitions across other Wyoming communities. Findings suggest a need to keenly attend to power dynamics and whose agency is driving higher education institutions’ roles in regional sustainability transitions in specific contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: This study, based on stakeholder theory, extends current research on the use of the market orientation construct in non-profit organisations, seeking to develop a new multidimensional scale that better fits the higher education context. More specifically, the main purpose of this research is to develop a stakeholder orientation (SO) scale for public universities. A mail survey was sent to all Spanish public university managers, which resulted in 1420 usable questionnaires. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling to develop the multidimensional construct. The findings confirm the applicability to higher education of this SO scale for focusing public universities towards their stakeholders. This SO scale is a multidimensional construct with five components, namely beneficiary orientation, resource acquisition orientation, peer orientation, environment orientation, and inter-functional coordination. This scale has more meaning for assessing the implementation of the marketing concept in public universities than the traditional market orientation construct. © 2016 ESIC & AEMARK

ABSTRACT: The aim of the study is to determine and confirm the main vectors that define the concept of sustainable university based on the example of a higher education institution that is representative for the Romanian economic higher education system. As objectives the authors defined the following: clarifying the concept of sustainable university based on the literature review; determining the main groups of stakeholders of the university and classifying them tridimensional; researching the perception regarding the vectors needed for the sustainable development of the university. The research stems from the three main stakeholders' categories, in the authors' opinion. A quantitative marketing research was undertaken on two main stakeholders' categories: students, and representatives of the business environment that are part of the Alumni Association of the university. Using the factor analysis, the four vectors that define, in the authors opinion, the sustainable university were validated, which was confirmed. A qualitative research based on a focus group among academia and management counterbalanced the results of the study, confirming through results the stated hypotheses. The limitations of the current study stem from the involvement of only a part of the university's stakeholders. Future research could investigate the perception of other stakeholders. © 2020, Editura ASE Bucuresti.

ABSTRACT: This paper provides an overview of the theoretical and empirical framework of the debate on widening participation in higher education and explores to what extent the lessons learnt in this field have been applied in the field of public policy. Widening participation is based on the assumption that the probability of entering and successfully completing higher education is contingent on a complex range of social, economic and cultural characteristics of potential students, and that the measures aimed at widening participation must acknowledge the multi-faceted nature of inequities in education. In this context, this paper analyses the extent to which international stakeholders in higher education acknowledge widening participation as a priority. Special attention is given to the question of whether their policy documents take into account the results and implications of empirical research in this field. Finally, the paper assesses the potential impact of these documents on the debate on this topic in Croatia.

ABSTRACT: This research explored the rebuilding of a public university, Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny, in the West African nation of Côte d'Ivoire, destroyed as a result of a highly contested Presidential election. We began by viewing rebuilding as the result of policy networks, a pantheon of interdependent actors cooperating and competing to address policymaking. Then we investigated the characteristics of these efforts, focusing on the policies that result from the complex interplay between university stakeholders and government bodies and the subsequent implementation of policy into practice. The study resulted in a preliminary understanding of one institution's rebuilding efforts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Managing laboratory safety at universities is critical due to a large number of laboratory accidents involving students that have been reported worldwide. This study primarily aimed to examine how safety knowledge and safety motivation directly affect safety behavior in laboratories among students. The study was based on a random sample of 361 undergraduates from five public universities in Malaysia. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) SmartPLS 3.3.2. The findings indicated that safety knowledge (β =.30, p <.001) and safety motivation (β =.15, p =.02) directly affected safety behavior among students in the laboratory. Furthermore, safety commitment mediated the relationship between safety knowledge (β =.13, p <.001) and safety motivation (β =.17, p <.001) on safety behavior among students in the laboratory. Safety commitment presented more substantial mediating effect compared to the direct effect of safety motivation and safety behavior. Accordingly, safety commitment was an essential element in enhancing safety motivation and safety behavior among students in the laboratory. These findings also affirmed that the combination of the subjective norm (safety motivation) and the intention (safety commitment) had a significant effect on safety behavior in the laboratory among students. In order to increase safety behavior in the laboratory, university managements should make continuous and concerted efforts through regulated guidelines to emphasize students' commitment. This highlights the importance of applying the theory of planned behavior-based educational approach and research intervention by the university stakeholders to enhance laboratory safety behavior among students. © 2020 Behavioral Science Research Institute.

ABSTRACT: The end of the COVID-19 pandemic that directly impacts students’ learning cannot be predicted with certainty. Previously dominated by face-to-face learning methods, student learning has fully transitioned into full e-learning, or online/distance learning provides a completely new experience for students. Students are important learning recipients and university stakeholders. Therefore, much attention should be paid to their learning satisfaction to ensure that higher education’s learning process is conducted well during a pandemic. The absence of quantitative empirical research on the drivers of e-learning satisfaction in the setting of private higher education is the theoretical impetus for this study. This study evaluated a learning satisfaction model during (early) the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire survey with a sample of 722 undergraduate students from a top-ranking private university was conducted in Indonesia, which reported the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia in 2020. Survey results identify the social presence, confirmation, and student-student interaction as the drivers of e-learning satisfaction during the pandemic. Moreover, robust learning system quality has a significant indirect influence on learning satisfaction that is mediated by student-student interaction. The findings of this study can provide implications for private university administrators in Indonesia to pay attention to and make improvements related to social presence, confirmation, learning system quality, and student-student interaction during a pandemic. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: With the transition to knowledge-based economies, higher education (HE) has become a driving factor for economic and social development. Alongside high-quality education and excellent research, social responsibility (SR) has become an important aspect of universities’ accountability and legitimacy. Considering the growing importance of SR for universities operating in stratified systems, the objective of this study is to analyse how HE research has conceptualised a socially responsible university over time and to understand the role of the institutional and organisational environment in the implementation of SR in universities. The study employed a systematic literature review of prominent HE journals, covering a 30-year period. Findings show that SR is an umbrella concept, which has evolved from being a moral duty to provide service to society, to engaging external stakeholders in universities’ core functions, and more recently to showing evidence of social impact. The extent to which SR becomes implemented and legitimised as a core HE function is influenced by institutional and organisational factors. National policies and public funding, organisational strategy and incentives, and faculty agency were found to be important levers of implementation. This study informs practical application by showing that the implementation of SR requires coherence between SR strategies and structures, and incentives to strengthen internal commitment to SR. Furthermore, it proposes a research agenda on the evaluation of universities’ social impact and the influence of institutional pressures on organisational responses for SR. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Adopting Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in Education is essential in 21st century to support, enhance, and optimise the delivery of information. ICT tools makes the education simpler and vibrant to all parts of the nation. Higher Education involves various stakeholders with multiple roles due to which collecting and analysing the responses is challenging task for the coordinators. Google Forms as part of ICT tools are used in data collection for various course registration/responses by the organizations. These collective help in authenticity, visualization and official timestamp. This paper highlights role of Google Forms used for conducting various surveys at RV College of Engineering. The process was enhanced using ICT for data collection from various stakeholders with the concept of anytime, anywhere. It was made flexible and streamlined through google forms by importing the responses from google forms in required file format for analysis and provide overall insights to all stakeholders in higher education. © 2020, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

ABSTRACT: Data curation is a concept with many facets. Curation goes beyond research-generated data, and its principles can support the preservation of institutions' historical data. Libraries are well-positioned to bring relevant expertise to such problems, especially those requiring collaboration, because of their experience as neutral caretakers and information professionals. This article details how one university library partnered with various campus entities, specifically the Office of Alumni Relations and the Photographic Services Department, as well as the Division of University Advancement, to further two data curation projects involving university yearbooks and a historical negative and photograph collection. Collaboration was necessary in order to achieve the desired result: the ongoing management and preservation of these resources for their promotional worth and as tools for scholarly research. These efforts allowed for the digitization, management, and preservation of the original resources as well as the creation and perpetuation of digital collections which are easily accessible to university stakeholders and the community at large. This cross-university effort illustrates how this type of data curation project can build both individual and departmental relationships, increase buy-in for all involved, and establish an infrastructure for the furtherance of future projects. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: Key points The 2017 Sci-Hub judgement has, to date, proven unenforceable, and it appears that enforcing the 2019 OMICS judgement will similarly prove challenging. Business developments and changing expectations over sharing digital content may also undermine the impact of the ongoing cases against ResearchGate and Georgia State University. Stakeholders should consider these limitations when deciding how to resolve scholarly publishing disputes. © 2019 The Author(s). Learned Publishing © 2019 ALPSP.

Student energy-saving in higher education tackling the challenge of decarbonisation
(2022) International Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education, 23 (7), pp. 1648 - 1666, Cited 9 times.

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134613460&doi=10.1108%2fIJSHE-10-2021-0432&partnerID=40&md5=4971192446a7816e090d6aa6defd5799

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This study aims to explore students’ sustainability attitudes and behavioural intentions and their relation to energy use, to promote energy saving and decarbonisation in higher education settings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a validated energy literacy survey to assess undergraduate students’ attitudes and behavioural intentions towards energy saving in two countries (Brazil and Belgium). The questionnaire, administered online, comprised 23 Likert scale questions and three questions eliciting socio-demographic information. Results were analysed using a linear regression model and compared with previous research using the same energy literacy instrument. Findings: The research identified three dimensions of sustainable attitudes: citizens’ role, scientists’ role and government’s role, explaining 65.5% of respondents’ energy-related attitudes. Three dimensions of sustainable behaviours were identified, explaining 64.5% of energy-related behavioural intentions: consumption of eco-friendly products, financially driven behaviours and household energy saving. The linear regression model identified scientists’ role, consumption of eco-friendly products and financially driven behaviour as the key predictors of student energy use. Differences between the two contexts also emerged. Research limitations/implications: Individual action to improve energy saving is necessary, but not sufficient for decarbonisation. However, student attitudes and behavioural intentions towards energy are an important element of campus decarbonisation: these “micro” experiments can become a “network” searching for synergies at the campus level (in collaboration with the neighbourhood) and act as a catalyst towards a more profound carbon-free society. Limitations of the research include the use of a survey to ascertain estimates of energy use; however, the study offers a model for further research and a mode of analysis that would be useful to other researchers. Practical implications: This research enables universities to better understand the drivers and barriers to student energy-saving activities and thereby promote decarbonisation on campus. This is a crucial underpinning in the creation of sustainable universities, linking education and campus developments. This survey was one of the catalysts to set up a total new maintenance energy performance contract (MEPC) at one of the authors’ institutions, where energy efficiency was realised alongside other sustainability aspects, such as water saving, circular renovation and waste reduction. Social implications: This research illustrates the challenges and opportunities of working with key stakeholders in university settings for university-based decarbonisation efforts. Intensive involvement of students and teachers in the new MEPC offers an example of co-creation with building “users” – which may have implications for other university building developments. Increasingly, universities need to consider the need for a new business model in which shared and multiple value creation is a key feature. Treating societal challenges as business opportunities is an important new dimension of corporate strategy and a powerful path to social progress, which higher education institutions should not overlook. Originality/value: Student attitudes and behavioural intentions towards energy are an important element of campus decarbonisation and can act as a catalyst towards a carbon-free society. Although energy literacy research has been undertaken in the USA and UK, this research is the first of its kind for Belgium and Brazil, and the mode of analysis – using a linear regression model – differs from the earlier work, offering a novel methodological approach. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: To what extent can transformation and development processes on a university or other campus fit in with the principles of circularity? This paper builds a bridge between the more theoretical approach of the circular economy and daily practice in campus development, using semi-structured in-depth interviews with a broad range of stakeholders in university management in Dutch universities. The study aims to show possible perspectives and offers insight into which factors are important for the sustainable development of a university or other campus, taking into account the principles of the circular economy. The paper introduces a framework for understanding the various dimensions and scales of campus operations. The aim is to make a practical contribution to the implementation of circular principles in campus development. The main conclusions are that circularity is an organisational issue, complexity must be reduced, and integral policy and specialised knowledge are required. Five recommendations towards an integrated strategy for circularity in campus development are given. © 2019 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Recently, campus free speech has become a focus of contentious debate and increased scrutiny. This study confirms that although university stakeholders may generally embrace the concept of free speech on campus, they also disagree about its limits and purpose within higher education, even if they are from the same institution. This investigation used Q methodology to scientifically study the subjectivity (viewpoints) among a diverse set of university stakeholders within the United States. Participants provided a snapshot of their views by sorting 55 statements related to speech on campus. The analyses revealed consensus, distinguishing statements, and rich descriptions of five unique speech on campus viewpoints: Idealistic, Social Justice, Speech Crisis, Sage on the Stage, and Fox News. These viewpoints provided insights about how university stakeholders perceive speech on campus. Consensus includes acceptance that ideas taught and expressed at institutions of higher education should rest with the faculty. Implications are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Society for Research into Higher Education.

ABSTRACT: The article deals with value creation measurement issue in public Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and discuss the linkage between selected Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and new multicriteria Factor Relationship (FARE) method capability to present accurate results when one of the Lithuanian universities is chosen. In order to enhance the precision of the results, the specifi c stakeholder group according to their power and willingness to cooperate was used as the basis for selected KPIs. Based on the stakeholders’ distribution the employees from the group with the highest power and cooperation level were chosen as a target group. The selection process was diverted to the criteria groups of effi ciency and internationality regarding to value creation process when public university is considered as a benefi ciary of value created. The employees of the university were compared against 6 criteria, 4 of which characterize specifi c performance of various types of employees based on internationality aspect which was considered as important component in overall performance, 1 refer to fi nancial performance activities and another 1 respond to resource contribution towards internationality in university as a whole. The minimum amount of initial data of the relationship between the chosen criteria group was taken from experts and used as the basis for analytical evaluation of other criteria groups’ relationship. Based on the new Factor Relationship (FARE) multi-criteria evaluation method, results concerning importance of each criterion were measured. The fi ndings showed which KPIs group plays the highest role in value creation process of selected Lithuanian university. The results showed that the most important criteria groups were professors’ internationality as well as Service and Administration Resources Environment. These two components had the highest importance weights compared with other criteria groups. © 2016, Technical University of Liberec. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This chapter presents an overview of the mechanisms (funding, policy, legislative and procedural) adopted by Latin American governments with respect to Open Access and Open Educational Resources (OER) initiatives in the higher education sector. It addresses three questions: How do the higher education systems of Chile, Colombia and Uruguay operate and fund their activities in general? How do existing policies and processes incorporating Open Access and/or OER influence student access to learning and research materials in these countries? What policy, advocacy and community-building interventions might be useful for promoting Open Education activities in these contexts? This study employed a descriptive, case study approach to examine whether and how Open Access and OER policies have been applied at national and institutional levels. It first engaged in an Open Education policy country-mapping exercise, then conducted a comparative analysis, and concluded the research process with a workshop conducted with 10 regional education experts and activists to validate findings. Findings indicate that while each country has its own approach to funding higher education, there are few or no specific national and/or institutional policies aimed at promoting Open Education in the higher education sectors. Low OER awareness and a commercialised model of higher education appear to account for the lack of any OER policies in Chile, while in Colombia various national and institutional strategies reveal a country at a nascent stage of Open Education policy development. By contrast, the nature of OER management and extent of policy implementation in Uruguay suggests that it is an enabling environment for current and future open policy development. ⊓ 121 Adoption and Impact of OER in the Global South 122 All of these countries are making investments in science, technology and innovation programmes and projects, making this the most fruitful field for potential Open Education advocacy. Based on the outcomes of this study, a number of recommendations are proposed, including: fostering and strengthening networks among Latin American civil society organisations promoting Open Education; engaging with higher education stakeholders on how to develop open policies; promoting open policies and mandates for publicly funded research; developing bottom-up and top-down strategies for greater engagement with OER; and providing greater visibility to existing Open Education projects in the region.

ABSTRACT: This paper aims to propose a quality assessment model for higher education institutions in the technical-technological field and a system for decision support and optimal management strategies for quality improvement. Obtaining research results is based on surveying stakeholders in higher education and obtaining quantitative data regarding key performance indices. Quantitative data and the genetic algorithm method are applied to determine optimal management strategies for quality improvement. Quality in the higher education sector is among the current issues in the academic community. By monitoring and researching the higher education field and analysing the literature and the current situation in the system of higher education in developing countries, it can be concluded that there is no single way to assess the quality of higher education institutions. This knowledge was a good starting point for the research presented in this paper. Accordingly, the findings include developing a system for quality assessment and the ranking of higher education institutions. Additionally, evaluating the relevance of key performance indicators of higher education institutions differs from different stakeholder perspectives. However, it is possible to develop a system for decision support and the selection of the optimal strategy for improving the performance of study programs and higher education institutions with regard to quality. The practical implications include defining a decision support system that enables the adoption of optimal decisions by the management teams of higher education institutions to improve study programs and the performance of the higher education institutions. The presented system may enable the benchmarking, simulation, and verification of different scenarios for improving the quality and performance of higher education institutions. In this paper, the authors analysed the characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks of different ranking systems to develop and introduce a novel ranking system that suggests weights for the ranking criteria and different perspectives regarding new digital age requirements. The model was tested, and the results are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the developed model. The originality of the research lies in the presented novel model that can be made available to government institutions and serve as a basis for the overall ranking and evaluation of higher education institutions, with the possibility of developing a performance-based funding system. Additionally, other stakeholders can gain an insight into the performance of an institution in relation to their needs and goals. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

ABSTRACT: As part of a wider study into perceptions that different university stakeholders have of tutorials, we investigated the UK Open University model for tuition through a process of semi-structured interviews with a self-selecting set of STEM tutors. The aim of the study was to elucidate perceptions that tutors have of the role and purpose of tutorials, and their perceptions of student expectations of group tuition. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts using a grounded theory approach identified several key themes. These include perceptions of the tutor role in group tuition: facilitating academic learning and skills; and supporting the building of confidence, motivation, social interaction and collaborative group-work skills. Difficulties were identified in encouraging student interaction in online synchronous tuition. In addition, mismatches became apparent between tutors’ perceptions of student expectations of tuition and their own preferred approaches, with suggestions that students expect a didactic rather than interactive experience. © 2018, © 2018 The Open University.

ABSTRACT: This study uses the stakeholder perspective to knowledge spillover theory at university to explain how various characteristics of internal and external university stakeholders will affect its entrepreneurial outcomes. Acknowledging the heterogeneity between entrepreneurial universities, we theoretically developed and empirically tested a model for four types of stakeholders (knowledge enablers, knowledge creators, knowledge codifiers, knowledge facilitators) across three university types (Russel group, teaching-based and polytechnic universities). To test our hypotheses related to the role of stakeholders in entrepreneurial outcomes of a university we used panel data on 139 UK universities that achieved entrepreneurial outcomes during 2010 and 2016. The results demonstrate significant differences in the role that stakeholders play in knowledge spillover entrepreneurship at universities with the effects vary across three distinct university types. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In accordance with the importance of the student stakeholder to universities, the objective of this research project was to evaluate student satisfaction at Portuguese public universities as regards their self-expressed core expectations. The research was based both on stakeholder theory itself and on previous studies of university stakeholders. The empirical study began with an exploratory study of students at one university to identify their demands, resulting in 25 indicators. These were the basis of a quantitative study, involving students at 11 Portuguese public universities. We received a total of 1669 correctly filled out online surveys. Data analysis deployed descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression. We conclude that the level of course requirements, enhanced student value in the employment market, personal student self-fulfilment, the university's environment, motivating lessons and university bureaucratic processes are the key demands strengthening and deepening student satisfaction with both their course of study and the university. Therefore, these factors should receive priority attention from university management. © 2013 © 2013 European Higher Education Society.

ABSTRACT: Globally, attention to quality and accreditation in higher education continues trending upward. This is attributable to a number of factors, such as the internationalisation of higher education, stakeholders demanding accountability, international rankings; parents and students wanting assurance that a diploma equals employment. Universities and individual programmes pursue accreditation because it is mandated; others to stand out in a crowded marketplace. The somewhat voluntary pursuit of accreditation raises two relevant questions. First, to what degree do teachers and administrators perceive its value? Second, for institutions and programmes seeking accreditation for the first time, is there a strategic approach that may effectively help prepare for the accreditation process? First, these issues are explored with teachers and administrators who have experienced the accreditation process. Second, using Bolman and Deal’s four frames for organisational analysis, this research proposes a strategic approach to analysing the institutional context and laying the foundation for successful accreditation efforts. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Is English A Form of Imperialism? A Study of Academic Community’s Perceptions at Yogyakarta Universities in Indonesia
(2012) Asian Englishes, 15 (1), pp. 4 - 27, Cited 10 times.

ABSTRACT: The paper highlights Indonesian university stakeholders’ perceptions of English in relation to identity. The questions addressed are whether or not English is viewed as a manifestation of imperialism, and whether or not English is seen as influencing national and religious identities. This is important because earlier research frequently “neglected, dismissed, denigrated, or proscribed” speakers’ viewpoints (Kroskrity, 2004). Also, the context of study is significant since previous studies have found that English is in contest with Islam (Karmani, 2003, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c; Rahman, 2005; Widiyanto, 2005), the religion held by most Indonesians. The data collection was carried out at nine prominent universities in Yogyakarta Indonesia in 2009. Forty-three individual interviewees and 305 questionnaire participants were involved in the study. The interviewees consisted of Rectors, Vice Rectors for Academic Affairs, English Lecturers, Lecturers of subjects other than English, and students. The questionnaires were distributed randomly among students from these nine universities. The participants were found to perceive English positively. They view English as somewhat imposed upon them, yet the positives English clearly offers outweigh the negatives since they expressed a desire to learn and use the language. It was found that the participants continuously negotiate their identity as Indonesians and their desire to communicate in an international language for the sake of advancement, regardless of their beliefs. © 2012 ALC Press, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Concerns about mental health and wellbeing in doctoral researchers have grown in recent years. To address these concerns, preventative strategies that seek to mitigate the onset of poor mental health and wellbeing could be valuable. This article outlines the co-design approach adopted to generate evidence that could inform the design of inductions to support mental health and wellbeing in doctoral researchers. Over a 9-month period, we collaborated with 47 doctoral researchers from 24 institutions and 13 stakeholders from one university, collecting qualitative data via focus groups and follow-up surveys. After analysing our data thematically and making refinements based on feedback from participants, actionable strategies that could be considered in the design of induction programmes for doctoral researchers were generated and captured by five themes: peer connections; supervisor relationships; information and resources; student services advice and support; and training and development. Feedback on the co-design process suggested participants felt positive about their involvement, with the doctoral researchers valuing the opportunity to contribute to the development of the co-designed evidence. Further research is required to examine the efficacy of the identified strategies, but we suggest that co-design shows promise for developing inductions to support mental health and wellbeing in doctoral researchers. © 2021 The Author(s).

University stakeholders’ perceptions of the impact and benefits of, and barriers to, human resource information systems in Spanish universities
(2022) International Review of Administrative Sciences, 88 (1), pp. 171 - 188, Cited 8 times.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this article is twofold: (1) to examine university stakeholders’ perception of the importance and benefits of, and barriers to, transmitting information on human resources collected in human resource information systems in universities; and (2) to understand stakeholders’ perceptions of the impact of the effective implementation of human resource information systems on university efficiency. To this end, a questionnaire was developed and sent to all members of the social councils of Spanish public universities. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance and linear regression analysis were used to answer the research questions. Our main findings revealed a strong emphasis on the need for universities to transmit information about their human resources from the implementation of human resource information systems. Specifically, university stakeholders perceive as very relevant the provision of information about the academic and professional qualifications of the teaching and research staff, the mobility of teachers and researchers, scientific productivity, and teaching capacities and competences. Likewise, findings suggest that increased transparency, quick responses and easy access to information were the main benefits of the implementation of human resource information systems, while the lack of commitment from top management and insufficient financial support were perceived as the greatest barriers to human resource information systems in selected universities. Finally, the results confirm that a well-implemented human resource information system has the potential to enhance human capital efficiency in universities. The findings provide some insights into the performance and applications of human resource information systems in Spanish universities that could help human resource management practitioners to get a better understanding of the current uses, benefits and problems of human resource information systems, which, in turn, will improve their effectiveness in Spanish universities. Points for practitioners: A well-implemented human resources information system has the potential to improve the efficiency of human capital management. This study contributes to practical knowledge by helping professionals in charge of human resources management to better understand the benefits of and barriers to implementing human resource information systems in universities, enabling the better future management of human resources in them. Likewise, this article provides managers with a greater understanding of the effects of human resource information systems on efficiency and shows that they represent a key factor in improving university performance. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: Several land-grant institutions have adopted a name to encompass the teaching, research, and Extension components of the university, creating a brand identity for those public services. But, in the mind of stakeholders, has the connection between the tripartite mission and the brand name been made? The study reported here sought to determine agricultural producers' and community leaders' awareness and perceptions of the mission of a land-grant institution. Both groups were informed and held positive views about the research, education, and Extension activities of the university, but, unaided, did not connect these activities with the brand name. © by Extension Journal, Inc.

ABSTRACT: The article offers a critical analysis of the impact of digital technologies on higher education. The digitalization of higher education is discussed in relation to broader socio-cultural and political and economic challenges: globalization, commercialization, socio-economic inequality and ethical issues of technology application. Using this approach, it is demonstrated that the rapid digitalization of higher education during the pandemic has activated already existing points of tension and problematic trends: the 'McDonaldization' of education, new managerialism in higher education governance, increasingly consumerist attitudes to learning, and the development of the elite education model. Secondly, digitalization has introduced new risks related to the growing influence of global technology companies, online modes of the commodification of learning, the digital divide as a factor of educational inequality, and new ethical challenges. If these risks are not addressed in a timely manner, digitalization may jeopardize the creative self-organization of educators and students, hinder the development of diverse and ethically responsible practices of technology use, and further unbalance the higher education system and increase its dependency on commercial technology companies. To mitigate the risks, it is recommended that the academic community scrutinize the educational principles and ideas that currently guide the development of educational digital technologies, and that it should take a proactive stance on how these technologies should work and which pedagogical and ethical principles should inform their design. It is likewise essential to support the development of alternative models of digital technologies for education to be designed in partnership with all stakeholders in higher education. © 2022 Moscow Polytechnic University.

ABSTRACT: Coalitions of powerful higher education stakeholders, a weak federal government, controversial overlapping policy domains, and a vulnerable postdoctoral labor force combine to create exploitative conditions in the United States. Recent calls for postdoctoral reform are likely to fall by the wayside, just as they have for the last half century. We use several analytic tools to examine the situation: a thematic content analysis of National Academy of Science reports dating back to 1969, stakeholder analysis based on the content analysis, and an in-depth demographic assessment of the postdoctoral labor force. We use these data in concert with agenda-setting theory to explain why major change has not occurred, and is unlikely to occur in the future. We suggest that one way forward is for the federal government to engage in bureaucratic reforms, which are more politically insulated than the domains of science, education, immigration, and inclusion policies in the USA. © The Author(s) 2018.

ABSTRACT: The study investigates factors motivating universities to engage in international degree collaboration. The Finnish-Russian university framework is used as the locus for studying international collaboration. The paper employs resource dependency and institutional, stakeholder and market push and pull perspectives in a conceptual model explaining the drivers of international degree collaboration. The research focuses on the interaction of the various factors that motivate partners to seek international degree cooperation, possible sources of conflict, and issues of compatibility and complementarity. In particular, the study compares the roles of different stakeholders and the institutional contexts of Finland and Russia. The motives of the Finnish and Russian universities included in the study were found to be generally compatible, yet different enough to complement each other. © 2018, © 2018 SEFI.

ABSTRACT: Open University Business School Management Learning Research Unit, Milton Keynes, UK A conceptualisation of higher education (HE) in the UK from a systemic perspective is introduced and discussed briefly. This conceptualisation suggests system levels and stakeholder sets for each level. Design approaches to systems design (design of design systems) are noted briefly as possible alternatives to systems engineering in addressing the problem field. Questions are then raised that the various groups of stakeholders might wish to debate about design of HE in the UK. These questions have political connotations. Some examples of system descriptions are suggested as preliminary hypotheses for answering these questions and some empirical evidence for the validity of the descriptions is offered. Systemic interactions within HE in the UK influencing potential solutions to some of its problems are discussed in terms of effectiveness and efficiency rather than ideology. The ramifications of some of these problems are explored; the argument returns to the need to resolve ideological issues before solutions to the problems can be attempted. The paper hopes to open debate, to stimulate development of some of the ideas presented and to initiate research collaborations. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The study is to propose a theoretical framework for a value co-creation process based on Service Dominant logic and to explore the effect of value co-creation on student benefits in a higher education environment. We applied value co-creation in an online education platform during the COVID-19 pandemic and conducted an empirical analysis on the value co-creation theory in higher education. We found the following results. First, co-production not only directly affects the value-in-use, but also affects student benefits, consisting of satisfaction and loyalty. Second, value-in-use also has a direct effect on student benefits and is more important than co-production in increasing student benefits in an online education platform. This study extends the Service Dominant logic theory by applying the Service Dominant logic, which has been widely studied in service marketing, to the higher education environment. This study also helps university stakeholders to understand the value of online education platform, understand the diversification of online education modalities, and understand the perspective of students as co-creator. © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Higher education, as one of the most important knowledge providers and service suppliers to the society, is obliged to produce qualified intellectual products through the process of knowledge transfer and creation, which depends largely on the quality of knowledge and the way it is delivered within a curriculum. This research takes e-tourism, a relatively new discipline, as a case study, highlighting a knowledge supply chain is the potential solution to leverage the understanding of tourism industry needs and tourism curriculum provision. The paper begins with a competency gap analysis between knowledge demand and supply. It then applies the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model to analyze the "as-is" situation of the present knowledge flow in curriculum design, and finally proposes a "to-be" conceptual framework by integrating tools and methods of knowledge management and supply chain management in a knowledge supply chain (KSC). This demonstrates that a KSC can help in achieving e-tourism requirements of higher education stakeholders at both industrial and academic levels Copyright © 2012, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: This paper aims to provide brief insight into the economic and sustainability challenges that higher education institutions are facing today globally. It provides a theoretical overview of key trends and challenges of higher education, relevant for the development of a sustainable and resilient European economy and society. We support our theoretical proposition by a bibliometric analysis of previous studies dealing with the 21st-century business skills and the sustainability outlook to be produced by the higher education sector. Our main findings are related to a significant rise of researchers’ interest in the topic, along with the multi-disciplinary approach being emphasized, as the academic community seeks how to contribute to the pressing issues of ensuring the integration of sustainability with employers’ requirements, related to new skill profiles, relevant for the European transformation toward a more resilient, digital, green economy and society. We evaluate the proposed course of research and provide recommendations to researchers and other higher education stakeholders interested in promoting this educational sector’s sustainability and relevance in the 21st century. © 2021 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Purpose – During the last 20 years or so the changing environment in which universities operate has meant that commensurately more emphasis has been placed on marketing principles. In light of this emphasis, it is perhaps a little surprising that relatively little attention has been directed towards the processes by which universities develop their products, and the extent to which module and programme development processes are market informed and customer oriented. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper adopts a case study methodology to examine early stage new product development (NPD) processes in UK higher education (HE) institutions. Findings – The findings reveal some potential shortcomings in the early stages or fuzzy front end of NPD in universities. In particular, there appears to be a lack of staff incentives, financial or otherwise, to innovate and introduce new ideas relating to module and programme development. Research limitations/implications – The issue of sample bias needs to be factored into however, given that these six institutions proactively engaged with this process possibly indicating a recognition or impetus on their part to learn how new programme development could be better understood. That the vast majority of the sample were teaching dominant institutions is also an interesting consideration as this will have an impact on the imperative to improve new programme development processes in an increasingly competitive HE environment. Practical implications – The paper discussed some of the implications for the corporate governance structures of universities and also emphasized the need for cultural change. In this respect, one of the biggest challenges facing universities is to break down or erode the barriers, which exist between academic and non-academic staff and create a “level playing field”. Originality/value – As the authors enter an era of higher student fees, the question of value for money combined with an associated increase in the expectations of university stakeholders, will have potentially quite marked implications for universities. Accordingly, the future viability of some degree programmes and, perhaps, even the long-term survival of some institutions may be dependent on the adoption of the sort of changes identified in this paper. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this paper is to report on the use of the soft systems methodology (SSM) to enhance the role of the higher education institution (HEI) stakeholder's action networks in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs). We review the literature on sustainable development in HEIs, in particular the role of stakeholder networks for the implementation of SDGs in HEI. We outline some of the features of SSM as an approach to help make sense of this complexity. CATWOE analysis, a conceptual SSM tool, is applied to a stakeholder's network hosted by a Brazilian university with the purpose of achieving the SDGs as part of the community projects (HEI external engagement). Findings of the systemic application suggest that the use of some elements of SSM helps clarify and make sense of the role of the stakeholders and assists in formalising action networks to achieve SDGs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Application of one's knowledge depends on one's values. Tendency to see knowledge separated from values prevents requisite holism, including in higher education (HE); one-sidedness causes oversights diminishing success and well-being of humans. HE-organisations create innovations and require requisite holism therefore; HE should view humans' multilayered attributes. HE stakeholders of, too, are multilayered individuals. Their success depends on their consciousness helping them attain more holism increasing their subjective well-being. This also increases creativity and innovation of employees in HE; it improves educational and research quality, which improves income and lowers costs of organisations due to values. Knowledge management must become requisitely holistic knowledge-cum-values-management. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents a multi-faceted analytical Course Innovation Framework (CIF) that can help institutes of higher education analyze multiple aspects of course innovation. The CIF was constructed by integrating insights from literature, policy documentation and course-innovation practices at Wageningen University and Research in the Netherlands. The resulting CIF considers multiple stages of course innovation–intended, implemented and attained–along with multiple innovation processes organized into the following five clusters: Rationale for the Innovation; Nature of the Innovation; Innovation in Teaching and Learning; Evaluation and Dissemination Strategy; and Consistency and Reflection. University stakeholders experienced the CIF as usable and relevant. This study is intended to generate a multi-faceted understanding of course innovation and to provide university policy-makers and educators with inspiration or even guidance in their efforts to analyze, map and decide upon their course-innovation practices. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The young population in Turkey is gradually increasing. Generation Y, which comprises the people born between 1980 and 1999 (Broadbridge et al., 2007) and free-spirited and tech-savvy, forms a large part of the population of the world, especially Turkey, and is of great importance to the housing sector for their home-buying preferences. In this study, housing preferences of students in Turkey’s two socio-economically different universities were comparatively analysed through quantitative methods. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was simultaneously distributed among students of two universities. The survey consists of six main factors: “reliability”, “economic opportunities”, “transportation opportunities”, “quality of life and social opportunities”, “quality standards”, and “technological opportunities”, with 25 statements. The questionnaire was developed through a comprehensive literature review and the opinions of university stakeholders. Findings: Results showed that the structure of the family and socio-economic differences affect home-buying preferences. The Mann–Whitney U test indicated that there was a meaningful difference of opinion between students of two universities. Munzur University students paid attention to economic opportunities when buying a home. Additionally, there was a meaningful relationship among the age groups in factors of “having a parking place” (p = 0.026) and “having a playground” (p = 0.026). As the age increases, students desire a playground around their future home. Research limitations/implications: The most important limitation of this study is the non-parametric data. Non-parametric data structure and the tests performed accordingly are less preferred than parametric data structure. For that reason, to what extent the results accurately represent Generation Y needs to be assessed through future study. Also, a certain number of sampling could be reached as purposive sampling was used. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature in terms of comparatively analysing buying preferences of Generation Y through statistical methods and showing the relationship between these preferences and socio-economic features statistically. Due to the insufficient quantitative research on the literature, this quantitative study was carried future home-buying preferences of Generation Y university students, who will also be actively involved in the housing market. The purpose of this study investigates marketing factors that affect housing preferences of students in Turkey. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Many academic libraries are coping with limited library staff, a burgeoning student population, and constantly evolving curriculum. How can academic librarians ensure that students are receiving a systematic and hierarchical set of information literacy (IL) competencies that will make them agile and adept information seekers and users who can cope with changing modes of information delivery and access? How can they be accountable to students, themselves, and to their institutions? Creating and implementing an information literacy curriculum map (ILCM) can provide a cohesive delivery of IL across the curriculum. A map aligns IL competencies with core courses, specific courses in a discipline, and assessment points. This article will describe the creation and implementation of an ILCM in addressing the needs of stakeholders at colleges and universities. The process of creating and use of the ILCM has facilitated and increased communication among teaching faculty, administrators, and academic librarians at Berkeley College. It has allowed the librarians to be more intentional in their teaching and assessment strategies. Furthermore, an ILCM used in conjunction with an assessment plan has served to make the IL programme and activities more transparent to the institution, thereby ensuring accountability to internal stakeholders and external reviewers. © 2015, CILIP Information Literacy Group.

ABSTRACT: Transforming Universities with Digital Distance Education explores the ways in which higher education stakeholders can apply and leverage the benefits of online learning. Systems-wide access, scale and quality are achievable goals but require forms of teamwork and financial modelling beyond those at the instructor or programme level. This book’s organisational view tackles the systems and practices that will help senior managers and decision-makers guide an entire institution away from dysfunction-incremental progress, insufficient capacity, high costs and generic products-and towards the macro-level implementation and operations of effective online pedagogies. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: The deadly effect of Covid-19 has changed the world dramatically. The education sector is one of the worst sufferers due to the official closures of educational institutions worldwide. The government of Bangladesh has declared all the on-campus activities shut in March 2020. This paper explains the effect of faculty and student readiness in adopting virtual classes considering the mediating effect of technology adoption intention. Teachers and students from private and public universities in Bangladesh are surveyed for this research. The findings revealed that the private universities are well ahead of providing online education as their faculty and students are ready with logistics and mindset to adopt technology-based virtual learning while the public university stakeholders are yet to initiate it. It is concluded that the lack of readiness of public universities will create a massive gap between public and private university education and rural and urban students as well. The proposed model of this research can help the policymakers and the government in formulating policy guidelines for bringing all the students and teachers on virtual education platforms irrespective of their university affiliations. © 2020 Sociedade Brasileira de Quimica.

ABSTRACT: Globalization and digitalization have dramatically changed higher education more than any other sphere of social or economic life. Constant flow of information and free access to all possible data, news, and topics, valuable and fake alike, imposed many challenges for the stakeholders in higher education worldwide. Lecturers and students worldwide became closer thanks to the new technologies, yet they also are drifting apart enclosed in single information bubbles. It is surprising that this digital epoch is seeing an increase in academic mobility worldwide. It appears that young people are willing to leave the comfort of their homes and social networks in order to experience the academic life and culture of other countries. It appears that this trend might also have considerable economic impacts on both sending and receiving countries. Our paper investigates the link between academic mobility and financial stability. We focus on the case study of academic exchange Erasmus program funded by the European Union (EU) and its impact on the financial stability of the Eurozone based on the criteria of the Optimum Currency Area (OCA). Our findings suggest that academic mobility indirectly improves financial stability in four fields: First of all, it enhances future labour mobility. Second, it decreases path-dependence and homogenizes policy preferences. Third, it induces more intensive trade relations. And finally, it increases international solidarity which is very important for such multi-national complex projects as the EU. © Foundation of International Studies, 2019.

The independent campus program for higher education in indonesia: The role of government support and the readiness of institutions, lecturers and students
(2021) Journal of Social Studies Education Research, 12 (2), pp. 280 - 304, Cited 5 times.
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110713401&partnerID=40&md5=567af1947569e1915a78016b70cf7c99

ABSTRACT: This study seeks to analyze the relationship between the Kampus Merdeka (Independent Campus) program of Indonesia and the readiness of stakeholders in universities, specifically whether the latter has a positive influence on implementing the program. The research applied a quantitative approach, which is suitable when trying to assess the appropriateness of an implemented educational program, while the analysis was informed by relevant prior research. It was necessary to learn whether there are internal and external factors support an implementation, so this research was conducted among private universities in Region IV (West Java and Banten Provinces) of the Higher Education Service Institutions of Indonesia with a sample of 111 lecturers. Based on the data analysis, the readiness of universities, lecturers, and students, as well as government support, were found to positively influence the implementation of the Independent Campus Program. More precisely, the effect revealed by the R2 value was 10.4 percent. Of the four independent variables considered, the strongest influence came from government support, with an R2 of 7.7 percent, followed by lecturer readiness (4.7 percent), student readiness (4.7 percent), and campus readiness (3.6 percent). All four of these independent variables therefore had a significant influence on the implementation of the Independent Campus Program, suggesting that any such implementation of the program must proceed in line with the preparedness of the relevant stakeholders. Strong support from the government also seems to be very important, however, if the Independent Campus Program is to achieve its goal of enhancing the capacity and quality of higher education in Indonesia. © 2021, Association for Social Studies Educa.

ABSTRACT: PurposeIn the face of continued criticism from Australian higher education stakeholders regarding problems with undergraduate business education outcomes; it is notable that little change has occurred to the philosophy, and the learning and scholarship activity underpinning Australian undergraduate business education since the early 1970s. Exceptions of recent times though include The Universities of Melbourne (UM) and Western Australia (UWA), Macquarie University (MU) and The Australian Catholic University (ACU). The purpose of this paper is to comment on this criticism and critique existing Australian curriculums and scholarship practices, and offer a potentially more informed and improved pathway. Design/methodology/approachThe paper expresses a viewpoint in critiquing Australian undergraduate business practices; including external stakeholder commentary, and supports a renewed curriculum focusing on personal growth and the early career needs of business undergraduates. FindingsThe paper argues for a more informed foundation to the undergraduate business curriculum; to wit, the traditional Aristotelian classical liberal approach, including scholarship aspects which assist in enhancing student values. Research limitations/implicationsWhilst the paper is limited to Australia, implications exist for other Western and Asian higher education environments. The paper is also limited to undergraduate business education, but also has implications for other undergraduate disciplines. Originality/valueWhilst not entirely original in its approach; the paper seeks a more informed balance of teaching, learning and scholarship approaches away from the traditional studia divinitatis approach based in skills and specialised knowledge, in favour increased attention to a studia humanitatis perspective, in pursuit of three principles: intellectual enhancement, moral behaviour and aesthetic appreciation. © 2013, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This study aims to use a holistic approach to empirically examine the direct and indirect relationships of both core and supporting consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) dimensions from students’ perspectives and the underlying impact they have on building a robust university brand equity. It also tests whether student perceptions of the importance of the brand equity constructs significantly differ based on demographics. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts the core and supporting university brand equity dimensions that have been tested for reliability and validity in prior research. Data were collected at a major university in the USA. The study used judgment sampling to carefully select a targeted sample of various colleges and class levels. A total of 439 useable surveys were collected. Findings: The results of partial least squares–structural equation modeling reveal significant relationships between both core and supporting brand equity dimensions. The core brand equity dimensions include brand awareness, perceived quality, brand association, brand trust, learning environment, emotional environment, university reputation and brand loyalty. The supporting brand equity dimensions include library services, dining services, residence hall and physical facilities. Significant direct and/or indirect relationships were found between the core and supporting CBBE dimensions. The demographic variables of gender, semester standing and living arrangement also influence the importance of some of the core and supporting dimensions. Practical implications: The results suggest that females, freshman and students living on-campus require specific attention in higher education. For a better representation and understanding of the university student population, we recommend that future studies use probability sampling and multiple universities for cross-validation. Originality/value: Using the brand ecosystem framework, this is the first comprehensive study testing the relationships between both core and supporting CBBE dimensions in higher education. The study offers valuable insights to university stakeholders for building a strong university brand. It also confirms that the measures of the CBBE brand equity dimensions are valid and are applicable to other higher education institutions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: The Internet is becoming more widely used by academic institutions to support the learning and teaching activities of students and academic staff. Whilst this is a very efficient mechanism, it is, arguably, important that there are adequate controls in place to ensure that the information is not libellous, defamatory, inaccurate, illegal or inappropriate. The interactivity of the Internet, the immediacy of access to its contents and the public accessibility to much of its information, however, do provide a different operating environment and therefore different audit and control issues arise. This paper discusses the roles and concerns of a range of stakeholders and suggests that the control mechanisms might be failing, or might not be adequately policed in practice. A number of examples are provided where the manner in which controls are put in place do not operate effectively, or where there may be control loops that are open-ended. For each of the stakeholder groups that are identified, an account is given of the use to which the Internet is put and where regulation currently exists or may be desirable. © 2003, MCB UP Limited

ABSTRACT: As an inevitable result of Russia’s higher education policies of the past two decades, new university leaders in and outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg have emerged, and vertical differentiation has increased. Inequality of educational potential has a strong regional dimension, exerting a considerable delayed impact on regional socioeconomic development. Differences in universities’ resources affected their ability to adapt their instructional, research, and administrative processes during the pandemic, thus broadening the education and research quality gap in higher education. Some regions may face an increased outflow of youth talent to universities based in Moscow and St. Petersburg, that will certainly weaken the socioeconomic growth prospects of Russia’s regions. The pandemic accelerated the debate over this problem and demonstrated readiness of universities for joint efforts. This leads to an expansion of policy to create a cooperative network of universities and their stakeholders so as to reduce institutional differentiation and promote exchange of experience and competence among universities. This paper investigates into the main characteristics of vertical differentiation in Russian higher education that had been in place when the pandemic broke out and determined whether universities succeeded or failed in switching to distance learning. Furthermore, lockdown measures and their economic impact on different types of universities are analyzed. Finally, we discuss possible avenues and specific considerations for expanding cross-institutional collaboration and engaging stakeholders in university development. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

ABSTRACT: This paper presents an alternative approach and preliminary results to developing a sustainable campus by connecting research, education and real estate management. It is coined ‘ShowHow’: the deployment and display of the knowhow of all stakeholders in a university. The approach is built upon five pillars: (1) Projects: the initiation of a variety of projects; (2) Intensive real estate involvement: the introduction of sustainability and innovation to all levels of real estate strategy and decision-making processes; (3) Programmatic themes: the development of multi-faculty, overarching programmatic themes; (4) Stakeholder integration: The involvement of and intense liaison and co-creation with real estate, facility management, professors, and students, and (5) Outreach: the provision of impetus for regional/national sustainability systems with campus projects. The results are encouraging: In a short period of time, one year, more than 20 projects have been developed, the board of the Real Estate department adopted sustainable development as a key value, three programmatic lines are under construction, personal connections between students, operational and scientific staff were established, and 2020 goals for greening the energy supply will be met in 2017. Additionally, the University also performs a catalyst role for regional sustainable heating transformations. New PhD positions could be established. This approach seems very promising, generating enthusiasm throughout the university. It has elements, typical for technical universities, but the formula may be replicated at other universities in general, by deploying non-technical knowhow, and by including existing local sustainability themes and opportunities. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The paper aims to discuss the relationship between interdepartmental stakeholders in higher education and the information identified as a result of collaborations. It proposes that collaborations can help clarify issues to then advocate for them. Design/methodology/approach: The paper opted for a naturalistic case study design, gathering direct and participant observation of interdepartmental collaborations including 1 Student Share, 12 one-hour collaborative sessions and 1 Accessibility Conference. Findings: The paper provides observed insight about student needs to have documents that are accessible for assistive technologies to recognize and read how change is brought about during internal brand building. It suggests that successful accessibility implementation in higher education calls for collaboration with stakeholders. Originality/value: This paper shows how a collaboration between the library and Student Disability Services can work to understand document accessibility issues. It also reveals that students with disabilities are adept with current mobile trends and technology, and need to be, for productivity in college. It will be valuable to librarians, faculty, staff and other technology stakeholders that work with students with disabilities. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The status of entrepreneurship education in Jordanian universities
(2019) Education and Training, 61 (2), pp. 169 - 186, Cited 13 times.
DOI: 10.1108/ET-03-2018-0082

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the developmental level of entrepreneurship education within the context of Jordanian higher education. The level of development in such education is investigated based on two areas: the educational courses and programs themselves and the formal structures within which they are embedded. Design/methodology/approach: The quantitative approach is based on a survey scan of all 29 Jordanian universities, including their course plans, educational programs, departments and centers. A list of entrepreneurship centers, programs and course subjects is provided and analyzed. Findings: The main findings of study are: in Jordan, entrepreneurship education is still at an early stage of development, and its offerings are limited to a few courses covering some introductory subjects in small business and entrepreneurship courses. Of the Jordanian universities, one university offers a major educational graduate program in entrepreneurship and 27.5 percent have centers for innovation and entrepreneurship, but lack any entrepreneurship departments. Entrepreneurship education is new in Jordan: the first provided course was a small business management; the first center was established in 2004 and later in 2012, it offered the first educational programs in entrepreneurship. Research implications: This paper assists all stakeholders in higher education to build an understanding of the nature of entrepreneurship education in Jordan and supports the design of appropriate strategies for encouraging entrepreneurial subjects to be incorporated into the country’s universities educational programs. Originality/value: The value of this study stems from its aim to provide an overview of the status of entrepreneurship education in Jordanian universities. It also makes a contribution to knowledge as the first nationwide study in this context. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Dilemmas in Re-branding a University—“Maybe People Just Don’t Like Change”: Linking Meaningfulness and Mutuality into the Reconciliation

ABSTRACT: This study examines the implementation of a re-branding campaign in a public Canadian university. Data collection comprised 19 qualitative semi-structured interviews with key internal university stakeholders (Dean and Mid-level Administrators). The data revealed three core dilemma pairs: (1) new brand vs. previous brand; (2) voice at the organisational level vs. voice at the departmental level; and (3) voluntary down-up voicing vs. up-down voicing. Results suggest that successfully implementing the new brand should not exclusively rely upon internal marketing communication; instead, internal branding through handling ambiguities and addressing emerging dilemmas by enhancing engagement, building mutuality and unlocking the meaning in the re-branding can help improve success. This study reveals that implementing a re-branding campaign in higher education involves embracing the world of dilemmas by involving and empowering employees in dilemma reconciliation. The reconciliation of detected brand-related dilemmas with and by employees can be achieved by involving employees in the process of re-branding from the beginning. Indeed, this paper suggests the preparedness to detect and address dilemmas is central to successful re-branding. Our results indicate that traditional change management approaches produce unreconciled dilemmas that hinder the implementation of the new brand. We conclude that efforts to build employee engagement in re-branding do not build employee supportiveness towards the new brand unless core dilemmas are reconciled. © 2019, Reputation Institute and Springer Nature Limited.

ABSTRACT: This article explores the trends identified in a survey of library directors on efforts to document and communicate library contributions to student retention. Library deans/directors have little in the way of communication methods for sharing library impact on retention. Methods that are used tend to be unidirectional in nature. Based on these results, this article also presents a framework of stakeholder markets and examples of reciprocal value propositions library leaders could develop around library contributions to retention efforts. This in turn can assist with advocacy and the communication of academic library value to university leaders and other higher education stakeholders. © 2017 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Just as with executive compensation in the corporate environment, the pay of university presidents has come under scrutiny. In this study, we examine the link between the level of abnormal compensation for university presidents in the current period and the subsequent performance of the university. We find that private schools awarding "excess" compensation (relative to schools with similar characteristics) improve their reputation and resources to a greater extent in the next two years than private schools not awarding "excess" compensation. Our results suggest that some portion of what appears to be excess pay in private schools is related to differences in the president's ability to deliver performance changes that would be valued by the university's stakeholders. Specifically, we find that private schools reward improvements in academic quality, but do not reward improvements in the academic environment such as reductions in class size. Conversely, what appears to be excess compensation in public schools is not related to performance metrics that are commonly used by the business press to rank universities, suggesting that performance metrics differ significantly between private and public schools.

ABSTRACT: This study aims to examine the effect of critical success and moderating factors in Indonesian public universities' business incubators. The study of business incubators benefits university professors in their roles as managers and advisors, university faculty entrepreneurs and start-ups/tenants in the knowledge transfer and entrepreneurship learning processes, and government officials in effective policy making. For the universities, the incubators serve as a platform for the commercialization of their research efforts. The incubators assist the universities' stakeholders in fulfilling their newly identified responsibilities towards building the nation's economy and giving the faculty members and graduate students the chance to conduct research. Regarding the economic environment, the incubators help create job opportunities, increase the country's economic value, and reduce poverty. This research employed the quantitative method approach, and the data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS version 23 and Smart PLS version 3 statistical software packages. The samples of this research were comprised of 31 business incubator managers from Indonesian public universities. Although there have been previous models about critical success and moderating factors for business incubators in other countries, this study is the first that was conducted in Indonesia and found direct and indirect relationships between critical success factors and moderating success factors for Indonesian Public University Business Incubators. The results of the research demonstrated that good system and infrastructure showed a strong direct relationship with success factors and that information technology showed a strong relationship with the moderating factors, namely age and quality of facilities. Furthermore, mentoring and networking showed a strong relationship with the moderating factors good system and infrastructure and that university regulation had a strong relationship with moderating factor credit and rewards. Entry criteria, exit criteria, and funding support showed strong direct relationships to success factors. These findings could improve the management of business incubators in Indonesian Public Universities and allow them to more successful. © IJTech 2018.

ABSTRACT: Post-modern approaches to language policy have emphasised the role of agency in implementing and appropriating language policies. While agency is often perceived in positive terms, Liddicoat [(2019). Constraints on agency in micro-language policy and planning in schools. In J. Bouchard & G. P. Glasgow (Eds.), Agency in language policy and planning: Critical inquiries (pp. 149–170). New York: Routledge.] calls on language policy researchers to investigate its problems and constraints. This article discusses the interplay of structure and agency in educational language policies in Tunisian higher education, a sector characterised by a ‘benign neglect' approach to language policy. While doing so, it responds to Fenton-Smith and Gurney’s [(2016). Actors and agency in academic language policy and planning. Current Issues in Language Planning, 17(1), 72–87] observation that higher education contexts remain largely underexplored in the language policy scholarship. The article uses data from 12 semi-structured interviews from local higher education stakeholders in order to explore how their agency is exercised, rejected and contested. The study demonstrates that while agency creates room for flexibility and the ability to respond to changing local demands and aspirations, it can also cause problems such as inconsistency, uncertainty, and the reproduction of social inequalities. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Increasing calls from university stakeholders to optimise innovation capabilities has never been more urgent given the increasing link between industry and universities. However, innovation activities that underpin the commercialisation attempts of universities are seldom translated into commercialisation success. This is mainly attributed to poor management of innovation processes between innovation networks. Empirical evidence indicates that trust relationships between innovation actors are difficult to achieve because of the perceived risk of disclosure, managerial complexity and conflicts of culture. The purpose of this review paper is to examine how open innovation within universities enhances innovation practices that lead to commercialisation success. Other connecting variables that embody trust, motivation to innovate and strategic leadership are equally important. Several hypotheses are developed, and a research model connects the innovation constructs. This paper is expected to make a significant contribution to connecting literatures that inform successful university-led and industry-led partnerships. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Digital news media discourse on MOOCs has been pervasive in educational publications over recent years, and has often focused on debates over the disruptive potential of MOOCs at one extreme, and their survival at the other. Whether such articles reflect the concerns of academics and other internal university stakeholders is difficult to ascertain. This paper aims to determine the main concerns of internal university stakeholders in terms of their MOOC development and implementation work, and whether these concerns are reflected in the mainstream educational media. The study combines data from 2 previous studies (a content analysis of MOOC literature, and a grounded theory case study of internal university stakeholders) to establish key themes of concern for those working on MOOCs in Higher Education. An analysis of these themes in 3 educational media publications is then conducted for the year 2014. The findings indicate a clear focus in education media and among university stakeholders on new teaching practices and working dynamics in Higher Education as a result of involvement in MOOC development work. We argue that for many working on MOOCs in Higher Education, the debate about the future of MOOCs is over, and that more practical concerns of appropriate implementation and effective working practices are of greater importance.

ABSTRACT: The Center for a Sustainable University at the University of Hamburg, Germany (UHH), is an interdisciplinary institution wherein various university stakeholders work together towards creating a “University for a Sustainable Future”. Thus, it is an example for addressing processes of sustainable development according to the whole institutional approach outlined by the UNESCO’s Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (ESD). Moreover, the UHH Center for a Sustainable University is a field of application for sustainability-oriented organizational development. In this paper, the UHH Center for a Sustainable University is introduced and serves as a case study: First, a linkage between ESD and innovation processes is drawn and the advantage of organizational development for sustainability as a specific working domain is discussed. Second, barriers for sustainability-orientated transformation at higher education institutions are identified: Different barriers which emerge during the day-to-day business of the Center for a Sustainable University will be examined and deliberated. Finally, particular tools that might help to overcome these barriers are presented. In September 2015 the UN agreed on global goals for sustainable development (United Nations in Transforming our world: The 2030 agenda for sustainable development, 2015), and the UNESCO’s roadmap on education for sustainable development highlights the importance of learning and training for transforming our world in a social responsible and sustainable way (UNESCO in UNESCO roadmap for implementing the global action programme on education for sustainable development, 2014). Obviously, the awareness for sustainability-related topics increases—in society in general as well as in science and at higher education institutions (cf. Leal Filho and Zint in The contribution of social sciences to sustainable development at universities. Springer, Basel, 2016; Lozano et al. in J Clean Prod 108:1–18, 2015; Schneidewind and Singer-Brodowski in Transformative Wissenschaft: Klimawandel im deutschen Wissenschafts- und Hochschulsystem—Transformative Science—Climate Change in the German scientific and university system. Metropolis, Marburg, 2013). Whereas numerous good practice projects and initiatives have been set up and collected that showcase “green campus development” (e.g. Bellantuono et al. in Introducing the Graphical Assessment of Universities’ Sustainable Image (GAUSI) instrument: A marketing tool. Springer, Switzerland, pp. 213–228, 2016; Finlay and Massey in Int J Sustain High Educ 13(2):150–165, 2012; Atherton and Giurco in Int J Sustain High Educ 12(3):269–279, 2011) and the contribution of research and science to various problems that come along with climate change (cf. IPCC in Summary for policymakers. Climate change 2013. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and New York, 2013; Costanza et al. in Sustainability or collapse?: An integrated history and future of people on earth. MIT Press in cooperation with Dahlem University Press, Cambridge, 2007) the question of how to institutionalize integrated sustainability-related activities at organizations—and especially at universities as “cultural reference points for their communities” (Paleari et al. in J Technol Transf 40(3):369–379, 2015, p. 369)—is addressed only recently. How can structures for sustainable development at higher education institutions (HEIs) be established that incorporate all stakeholders and that help to engage in sustainability-promoting behavior at all levels? Whole-institution approaches (WIAs) are in demand (UNESCO in UNESCO roadmap for implementing the global action programme on education for sustainable development, 2014), yet theoretical and practical frameworks for fostering sustainability-related motivation and behavior in vocational settings at HEIs are sparse. Systematic methods as well as methodologies that can be used to realize WIAs haven’t been developed and explored sufficiently so far. Drawing from the experience of the Center for a Sustainable University (KNU) at the University of Hamburg (UHH)—one of Germany’s largest Universities with more than 40,000 students and 5000 members of staff (Präsidium der Universität Hamburg 2016)—this paper introduces tools and methods for targeting a whole-institution approach in order to generate and strengthen transformational processes toward sustainability. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Understanding key stakeholder belief systems or institutional logics related to non-tenure-track faculty and the changing professoriate
(2014) Teachers College Record, 116 (10), Cited 7 times.
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068430201&partnerID=40&md5=cadbdac9832d32560e0cabc7cb98268c

ABSTRACT: Background/context: Over the past 40 years, the composition of the professoriate has changed substantially across all institutional types. Once predominantly tenure track, now nontenure-track faculty (NTTF) constitute more than 70% of the faculty. While these major changes have occurred, we know little about key stakeholders' views (accreditors, policy makers, presidents) of these changes. Purpose: In this article, we explore the following research question: What are the belief systems (logics) related to the changing professoriate of the key entities within the higher education organizational field? Population/description of participants: Thirty-five individuals from key stakeholder groups were included: accreditation agencies; disciplinary societies; faculty stakeholder groups such as New Faculty Majority; unions; state or system leadership and state compacts such as National Association of System Heads; voluntary regional consortia such as those representing deans; governing boards; and individual and institutional membership associations, including the American Council on Education and American Association of Community Colleges. Research design: In order to better understand the perspectives of key stakeholders in higher education's organizational field related to the nature of the professoriate, we conducted a modified Policy Delphi study. Findings: The findings indicate one of the major reasons that the organizational field did not provide a shield to the decline of tenure or mobilize to combat the deteriorating conditions of nontenure-track faculty is because no new decided upon logic has been created as it relates to the professoriate. Great disagreement exists about what the future professoriate should look like and the four distinctive views are presented.Conclusions: There is some opportunity for consensus and mobilization around two key points: (a) All groups believe the current three-tiered model (shrinking tenure track, large part time, and full-time nontenure track) is not working; and (b) there is broad consensus about a few principles for a new model such as greater job security, shared governance, greater academic freedom than most faculty currently have, and more focus on the educational function of faculty. © by Teachers College, Columbia University.

ABSTRACT: Quantitative literacy has been recognized as an important skill in the higher education and workforce communities, focusing on problem solving, reasoning, and real-world application. As a result, there is a need by various stakeholders in higher education and workforce communities to evaluate whether college students receive sufficient training on quantitative skills throughout their postsecondary education. To determine the key aspects of quantitative literacy, the first part of this report provides a comprehensive review of the existing frameworks and definitions by national and international organizations, higher education institutions, and other key stakeholders. It also examines existing assessments and discusses challenges in assessing quantitative literacy. The second part of this report proposes an approach for developing a next-generation quantitative literacy assessment in higher education with an operational definition and key assessment considerations. This report has important implications for higher education institutions currently using or planning to develop or adopt assessments of quantitative literacy. © 2014 Educational Testing Service.

ABSTRACT: Universities were forced to move instruction online and send residential students home due to the pandemic, resulting in financial shortfalls. Governing boards, administrators, and governments made decisions including eliminating faculty and staff, and programs yet these decisions were rarely inclusive of university stakeholders or innovative. This study’s purpose is to examine and compare viewpoints of stakeholders in relation to addressing the financial impact of the pandemic in hopes of capturing innovative and effective pathways for universities. Because the purpose involved describing and comparing these viewpoints, the researcher selected a unique mixed method, Q methodology [Q] for this study. In Q, participants sort statements related to the topic into a grid such that their Q-sort provides a snapshot of their subjectivity. Participants’ sorts are grouped empirically into factors, each representing unique viewpoints. Three distinct viewpoints emerged: 1) Focus on teaching mission and students, 2) University as a business, and 3) University as community. Views 1 and 3 were dominated by university faculty while View 2 was dominated by non-faculty including administrators and staff. Q’s determination of distinguishing statements within each view provides the ability to compare these views’ uniqueness. The three views and consensus among the views represent rejection of decisions to lay off faculty or close programs, among others, in order to balance university finances. The importance of tenured faculty in relationship to shared governance and academic freedom is especially stressed by two of the viewpoints. Implications for higher education policy, innovation, democratic problem-solving, and governance are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

The changing attractiveness of European higher education in the next decade: Current developments, future challenges and major policy issues

ABSTRACT: This article focuses on the different senses of the attractiveness of European systems and institutions for students, academics, the labour market and the economy, drawing attention to emergent tensions between different university stakeholders. Universities not only need to be attractive to increasingly differentiated student populations, but they also need to be attractive workplaces and provide attractive career opportunities for academics. Both public and private institutions are under multifaceted pressures to change today. At a time of imminent reformulation of current welfare state systems in most parts of Europe, attractive systems will be able to balance the negative financial impact of the gradual restructuring of the most generous types of welfare state regimes in Europe on public funding for higher education. Ironically, the more successful public entrepreneurial universities are today, the greater the chances are of them following this entrepreneurial direction in the future. The promotion across Europe of a more substantial inflow of both private research funds and student fees can be expected. The possible redefinition of higher education from a public good to a private good is a tendency which may further undermine the idea of heavy public subsidization of higher education, as the economic rationale for higher education is changing. The expected developments may fundamentally alter relationships between university stakeholders, with the decreasing role of the state (especially in funding) and the increasing role of students and the labour market. The expected differentiation-related developments may alter the academic profession in general, and have a strong impact on the traditional relationships between teaching and research in European universities.

ABSTRACT: The global COVID-19 outbreak has caused an anxious situation in every part of society and forced many countries to implement distance education programs without even knowing the fundamental components involved in the processes and the consequences of their decisions. Likewise, in Turkey, it is still uncertain as to what will be taught, what instructional technologies will be employed, how infrastructural inequalities will be addressed, and how assessment and evaluation activities will be conducted. In this context, the purpose of this study was (a) to examine the experiences and opinions of academics, Distance Education Center managers, students, and parents and (b) offer solutions to emerging issues. In doing so, a qualitative research approach was employed, and the study was designed as a phenomenology. The data were collected from 175 individuals from 20 universities through Google Forms. The second cycle coding methods were employed in the analysis. The results indicated that COVID-19 had mostly psychological effects on individuals, and it affected every level of education at varying degrees. The pandemic reminded us how hopelessly we are dependent on traditional means of instruction by rendering us unable to use them. Since the beginning of the outbreak, many higher education institutions have been trying to implement distance education; however, the quality of instruction is rather questionable. This situation threatens the quality of learning outcomes and if not approached with due diligence, results could be catastrophic. Also, this mandatory transition to distance education has made the difference between the experienced and inexperienced academics more apparent. In light of the results, recommendations were provided for national and international policymakers. As long as the recommendations were implemented, all higher education stakeholders could attain the required knowledge and skills, and, in return, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could be alleviated. © 2020, Duzce University, Faculty of Education.

ABSTRACT: There is currently a growing interest in the improvement of university governance and the disclosure of information on corporate governance processes as an essential part of the transparency and accountability of universities. This paper aims to know the importance given by Spanish university stakeholders to the disclosure of information about structure and mechanism of corporate governance. To meet this objective, we propose a model for disclosing information on the main aspects of university governance in Spanish universities. This model will be validated using a questionnaire sent to members of the Social Councils of public universities in Spain. Our results show that Spanish university stakeholders attach great importance to the disclosure of specific information on aspects of corporate governance, which would result in improved transparency and accountability. No previous research was conducted for Spanish universities. This brings new expertise regarding the need to carry out a proactive publication of information on corporate governance in the Spanish university accounting information model. © 2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The majority of research concerning student veterans has been conducted at the university level, with minimum analysis performed at the level where the vast majority of returning veterans attend school: the community college. While some research has discussed what services colleges and universities should offer returning veterans, little research has been conducted on understanding the actual experiences of veterans making the transition from service member to college student. A group of varied gender and racial backgrounds took part in an effort to describe the lived experiences of combat veterans making the transition into community college after active military service. Findings include the inadequacy of current models for use in understanding student-veteran transition experiences, particularly at the community college, and the discovery that the majority of student veterans involved in this study do not take part in on-campus programs specifically designed for them. The experiences of military veterans who enroll in community colleges subsequent to deployment in a combat environment since 11 September 2001 have not been adequately researched and remain misunderstood (Ewing, 2011; Gomez, 2011; Karni, 2011; Wood, 2011). Existing models of student transition used to describe the student-veteran experience are largely inadequate and framed around traditional 4-year colleges and universities. As a result, higher education stakeholders may not have the necessary information to effectively assist this growing student demographic. Further research will increase the body of knowledge in this important area and, it is hoped, lead to more effective educational policies regarding student veterans. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: This paper analyses the unique case of Kosovo alongside the broad context of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) development. Kosovo started implementing the Bologna Process in 2001, although to date, it has not been formally admitted as a member. This paper provides evidence on the impact of the Bologna-influenced reforms on developing quality assurance and enhancement in Kosovo’s higher education during 2001–2019. The study opted for a qualitative method design combining content analysis and semi-structured interviews to investigate both the normative and operational aspects of institutional learning and change that followed these reforms. The study builds on other Bologna-related studies, demonstrating that higher education institutions have placed accountability at the forefront of their ambitions. Findings recommend that a balance between quality control and improvement is imperative towards developing a quality culture. Therefore, there is a need to redistribute quality assessment ‘power’ equally among all stakeholders in higher education. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report findings from the first stage of a study that focusses on research in the domain of entrepreneurship as a process of knowledge creation and exchange. It seeks to discover what entrepreneurship scholars really believe that they contribute. Focusses on the entrepreneurship academic community and examine two issues: the value scholars perceive, in terms of both how an individuals’ work can be seen to be a contribution to knowledge, and what “contribution to knowledge” means to the individual researcher. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ a qualitative approach within which 20 entrepreneurship professors were asked to complete a semi structured research instrument to express their opinions on the value of the authors’ research and the extent to which the authors’ work contribute to knowledge and practice. The sample was drawn from full entrepreneurship professors from the UK, USA, Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. Findings: Suggest that entrepreneurship scholars publish for a plurality of reasons including personal fulfilment, interest, and necessity. It was also noted that the motivations for academic scholarship have changed with increased internal and external pressures and a drive to publish in certain journals. Research limitations/implications: This is a novel study not undertaken previously in the entrepreneurship discipline. The results will inform research practices within the entrepreneurship discipline and represent the basis for an ongoing large scale global quantitative study of the entrepreneurship discipline. Originality/value: The outcomes of this research inform higher education stakeholders in the construction of valid research strategies thus providing a suitable impact upon academia and society. It provides an initial insight into drivers for academic research within the entrepreneurship discipline, and the opportunities, challenges and paradoxes which various approaches to research contribution entail. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Popular social networking sites such as Facebook demonstrate an emerging opportunity for students and educators within formal higher education contexts to share ideas, celebrate creativity and participate in an environment which offers immediate feedback from others who belong within a specific network. As this is an emerging use of the technology, an autoethnographic approach has helped capture the potentials and pitfalls of incorporating social networking within higher education. The findings highlight implications for the key stakeholders in higher education. © 2011 Julie Willems & Debra Bateman.

ABSTRACT: Student retention has emerged as a significant and expensive challenge for higher education institutes worldwide. Although several studies have been conducted on increasing student numbers and diversity in higher education institutes, studies on the relationship between student retention and entry grades are limited, particularly in the UK. The aim of this paper was to examine the relationship between entry grades and student attrition in the context of higher education in the UK. A quantitative methodology was used in this study, wherein data were derived from secondary sources, including University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) tariff points and full-and part-time undergraduate student enrolment between 2012 and 2017. The data were extracted and analyzed using Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) performance indicators. The findings indicate that there exists a clear association between entry grades and student retention for part-time students, which may aid policy makers, academics, university staff, and higher education stakeholders to develop appropriate strategies to address attrition levels. © 2020 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: Academic libraries in universities store large volumes of research that can be used for development purposes to support teaching, learning, research, innovation, community outreach and partnerships. Library automation incorporates the adoption of integrated library systems. Effective adoption of an integrated library system enables broad-based access to global and local knowledge sources to solve local, regional and national development challenges. Using a sequential mixed methods approach in a case study of a Ugandan public university, Kyambogo University, this study investigated the perceptions of librarians, information workers and other university stakeholders with respect to library automation and the contribution thereof to national development. The results confirmed that the integrated library system improved library operations and played an important role in supporting national development. This study also highlights the continued challenges of adopting an integrated library system in developing countries such as Uganda, which, if addressed, could further improve information service delivery for a nation’s socio-economic transformation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.

ABSTRACT: Transitioning to university can be anxiety-provoking for all students. The relationship between social anxiety, autistic traits and students’ social network structure, and perceived support is poorly understood. This study used a group-matched design where autistic students (n = 28) and typically developing students (n = 28) were matched on sex, age (17–19 years), ethnicity, pre-university academic performance and degree subject at university. Autistic students reported greater transition to university worries, and a smaller social network size compared to typically developing students, though perceived similar levels of support from their social networks. Autistic and typically developing students showed differential patterns of association with both autistic traits and social anxiety. Broader clinical and practical implications of findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.
Transitioning to university can be anxiety-provoking for all students. The academic, daily living and social difficulties can become magnified for autistic students when considered alongside the social difficulties associated with autism, as well as higher levels of co-occurring social anxiety. Although previous studies report poor transition outcomes and retention rates for autistic students, it is unclear whether: (1) the academic, daily living and socialisation difficulties reported are unique to autistic students; (2) whether there are differences in students’ social networks at university, as well as their perceived level of support provided by network members; and (3) to what extent these difficulties may be accounted for by social anxiety found in both autistic and typically developing (TD) students when transitioning to university. This study compared a group of autistic students transitioning to university against a group of TD students who are similar in age, sex, academic performance prior to starting university and subject of study at university. Autistic students were found to be more socially anxious, more worried about different aspects of university life. Autistic students had a smaller social network compared to TD students, though both groups perceived similar levels of support from their social networks. Higher levels of social anxiety common to both groups, not autistic traits, was associated with greater distress in daily living and socialisation at university. University stakeholders may consider providing more psychoeducation and support around social anxiety for both autistic and TD students transitioning to university, to improve transition outcomes for all students. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: The “employability” paradigm is beginning to be publicly regarded as one of the key developmental paths and “modernisation” principles of higher education institutions. In this context, the article first overviews the existing practices for tracking graduates’ early careers in Europe. Next, it identifies and discusses relevant conceptual aspects for designing system(s) for tracking graduates’ careers and using the results of graduate studies. This includes understanding and interpreting employability, possible societal tensions surrounding higher education when seeking to support the needs of graduates, employers or initiating new “professional projects”, and the development of disciplinary assumptions about career success. Third, based on the results of a national survey among higher education institutions in Slovenia, it explores institutional views related to establishing systems for monitoring graduates’ “employability”. Understanding higher education institutions’ attitudes and capacities towards monitoring the employability of their graduates is important for the success of tracking surveys in terms of their involvement in the collection of data, adapting the research instrument to reflect possible disciplinary particularities and the use of survey results. By combining the institutional perspective with the previously elaborated conceptual framework, the article calls on higher education stakeholders to support the strategic function of career monitoring systems for exploring new professional opportunities of graduates in the context of broader societal and economic developments. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

The perception of entrepreneurship culture by internal university stakeholders
(2020) European Business Review, 32 (3), pp. 443 - 457, Cited 6 times.
DOI: 10.1108/EBR-05-2019-0087
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082197596&doi=10.1108%2fEBR-05-2019-0087&partnerID=40&md5=3d8217a28554b7a9edaa6298fd1dfb26

ABSTRACT: Purpose: As nowadays the knowledge economy puts a strong emphasis on the universities’ role in the present economy, the recent challenge focuses on the interrelations between entrepreneurship culture and academic engagement. This study aims to investigate the new role that universities are assuming as entrepreneurial entities and gather information taking place internal university stakeholders and students’ perception on entrepreneurship education. The research hypothesis stands entrepreneurship is mainly supposed as being professionally and educationally active rather than setting up a company. Design/methodology/approach: The present study carries out a study on the perception of entrepreneurship education conducted among students of the University of Economics in Krakow in the winter semester of the academic year 2017/2018. The selected target group meets the criteria of the different national country origin of the respondents. Another criterion for selecting the target group was diversity in the field of students’ academic interests. Findings: The results of the study give a clear view of the still valid confirmation of the growing academic role in terms of entrepreneurship culture development that appears necessary to address the demand for global competitiveness. In particular, it is possible to categorize two groups of people, moderate and strong supporters of recognition that entrepreneurship is not only about starting a company but also at the same time that it is an expression of its own dynamic and entrepreneurial attitudes. Practical implications: As the importance of entrepreneurship in the context of an entrepreneurial university is rising and the definition of entrepreneurship goes beyond its understanding of starting a business, universities and academic engagement can and have to better address and focus their planning of the courses and their contents. Originality/value: The study sheds some light and gives some interesting perspectives on the issue of different levels of entrepreneurship education expectations against different levels at which this education should be provided. In addition, it is in line with the EU entrepreneurship competence framework (EntreComp) aimed at defining tools to improve the entrepreneurial capacity and culture of EU citizens and organizations by means of consensus among stakeholders and by establishing a bond between education and study. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This paper examined domestic educator and Chinese international student (CIS) perspectives on their experience of the commoditisation of international higher education in Australia. Data consisted of semi-structured interviews with academic and student participants. A Trans-disciplinary Framework derived from grounded theory and the Auditable Systematised Qualitative Analysis tool, provided structure and a method to systematise interview data. An interpretation of positioning theory gave insights into the perceived reality of research participants. Findings indicated that a number of academics struggled in their role as teachers of CIS. Concerns varied from disquiet about high fees to a perception that the quality of the teaching and learning program was lower because of the university’s emphasis on international students as a source of income. Conversely, some international students paid a high price for a Western education and considered success a fait accompli. © 2018, Education Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

Knowledge management initiatives for achieving sustainable development goal 4.7: higher education institutions’ stakeholder perspectives
(2023) Journal of Knowledge Management, 27 (4), pp. 1109 - 1139, Cited 10 times.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore knowledge management (KM) initiatives for achieving sustainable development goal (SDG) 4.7 and to investigate enablers and barriers to insert KM to prepare higher education institutions (HEIs) ready to contribute to SDGs’ performance. At the end, this paper provides a practical perspective of KM initiatives for higher education for sustainable development (HESD). Design/methodology/approach: This is an exploratory study. It applies a descriptive-interpretative-qualitative approach. The analysis is based on the opinions collected from 170 HEIs’ stakeholders. Discussions among participants have been organized through zoom meetings, telephone interviews and focus group discussions in three phases. In the first phase, a total of 113 informants took part in the discussion on various dates. In the second phase, 10 interviews were conducted with university officials using three open-ended questions; and in the third phase, three focus group discussions were organized to interact about the effectiveness of the Masters in Business Administration in Global Leadership and Management programme and curriculum with teachers, students and the programme initiators. Findings: From the analysis of stakeholders’ views, it appears that Nepalese HEIs have yet to move forward with integrating KM activities into their aims, structure and functions to address the government’s policy guidelines applicable to maximizing SDG’ performance. A KM cultural framework that values intellectual capital is urgently needed to fill the knowledge-doing gap for the benefit of society. HEIs appear to require multidisciplinary teaching, learning and research methods to play a civic role in society. They have to improve their rules and regulation, develop a boundary-spanning structure from a conventional structure and apply KM initiatives to support achieving SDGs’ performance. Understanding and inculcating these initiatives in the academic programmes could provide a value-adding higher education in the country. Research limitations/implications: This paper is entirely based on the perspectives of stakeholders in higher education. So, understanding their points of view and perspectives may have resulted in vague explanations. Furthermore, because the setting of Nepal’s HEIs differs from that of developed countries, the results should only be interpreted in Nepalese contexts. Practical implications: This paper acknowledges the gaps and complexities in Nepalese HEIs from the standpoints of HEIs’ leaders, teachers and students for the application of KM initiatives to reform HEIs, with HESD in consideration, and enhance SDGs’ performance. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the paper is the first of its kind in the context of Nepal, exploring KM initiatives for SDGs. It provides a new perspective on KM and comprehends KM initiatives in the case of Nepalese HEIs transformation into HESD for achieving SDG 4.7. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Blockchain, which is also called a distributed ledger technology (DLT), is an emerging and ever advancing technology having flourishing potentialfor nourishing and revolutionizing higher education. It stems in decentralization and distributed learning with characteristics of permanence of records, pursuit and transfer of knowledge, authority of institutions, and reliability of teaching and learning. These characteristics of blockchain attract educational institutions particularly the higher education institutions to adopt it. However, in spite of all potential and benefits of blockchain technology, the higher education stakeholders currently seem to be less aware of the social benefits and educational/instructional potential of blockchain technology. It can be addressed through proper advocacy and campaign. The complete chapter will demonstrate possibilities of blockchain technologies in higher education along with its issues and challenges. © 2020 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected educational institutions worldwide. The closure of schools and universities has led to a sudden shift of teaching away from the classroom to online learning. However, with little preparation, both teachers and students struggle with remote teaching and learning. Responding to the situation, IEEE units (including Councils/Sections as well as Education Society and local chapters) and different stakeholders in universities have quickly developed supporting programmes within a short period of time. After months of experimentation, it is beneficial to share experience gained and showcase resources developed, such that we can build responsive and resilient curriculum for the next normal. The session will be started by several invited lighting talk presentations, followed by a panel discussion and networking sessions. The major intended participants would be officers and members of Education Society local chapters. Teachers and other stakeholders are also welcome to participate. © 2020 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: This article presents the results of applying a theoretical model for analyzing the interested parties to which the university directs its contents and website links, for a sample of Spanish universities in Castilla and Leon and Andalusia. Some main aspects of the stakeholders concept are analyzed: its roots, principle exponents, definition, application areas, effects on organizational functioning and the main typologies existing in the literature; and the results obtained from observation and analysis of the Web sites for each university considered in the sample, contrasting them with the theoretical model developed for types of interested parties. It was observed that, at the universities of Castilla and León, the main stakeholders are the students, the employees and corporative government with a strong orientation toward the internal interested parties. In the case of the Andalusian universities, contents and weblinks are focused toward a greater variety of interested parties, adding the labor unions, student and supplier organizations and, to a lesser degree, commercial associates.

ABSTRACT: Digital learning can finally help students in the teaching and learning process. It became necessity due to the global crisis of the pandemic COVID-19. Lecturers have no choice but to provide excellent education online, including technical and vocational education and training (TVET). TVET face-to-face teaching is more practical than online teaching. A preliminary study was conducted to look at the need for a framework in digital learning on TVET in Public University, Malaysia. The instrument used in this study was an online questionnaire (Google Form) that was emailed to lecturers. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 26.0. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed in the form of mean and percentage scores. A total of 51 lecturers answered this questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of the demographic respondent, lecturers’ knowledge of online teaching and learning, lecturers’ knowledge of digital learning, faculty readiness, and infrastructure needs in educational institutions. The finding is that lecturers' knowledge of online teaching and learning is moderate, lecturers' knowledge of digital learning is high, faculty readiness is high, and infrastructure needs are high. The findings could be used by the higher education stakeholders for developing a framework in TVET digital learning in nurturing the creation of high quality and effective online teaching and learning content. © Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia Publisher’s Office.

ABSTRACT: Since the eruption of student protests in 2015, 2016, and part of 2017 across almost all South African university campuses, the question of transforming universities and decolonising university curricula have been at the epicentre of academic discourses. University Transformation Committees and Student Representative Councils are now more than ever challenging university stakeholders not only to transform staff and student demographics as well as institutional structures, but also to decentre Western epistemic traditions, which have dominated the scholarship of teaching and learning in South African universities. This article reflects on existing literature on transformation of South African higher education and classroom discussions with students to understand and link curriculum decolonisation to social justice and agency. It explores how colonial and apartheid matrices of power, culture, and knowledge intersect with classroom pedagogies to entrench Western epistemologies in South African universities. The article also examines ways through which the subordination and marginalisation of African knowledge systems silence South African students' voices and perpetuate different forms of epistemic injustices. Finally, it discusses different strategies to disrupt Western epistemic domination and to restore African ways of knowing and being in mainstream university curricula. © Common Ground Research Networks, Pineteh E.

ABSTRACT: Teachers' ICT implementation is of growing importance in classrooms; currently, technology has become an essential ingredient of teachers' practice. The study explores the implication of teachers' competencies on ICT implementation in universities. The empirical literature has established a considerable research gap despite teachers' competencies being critical in ICT implementation. The study presents a university survey in Kenya on 475 teachers exploring the implication of teachers' ICT competencies on ICT implementation and teachers' skills and knowledge. The descriptive statistics results indicated a mean of 4.279 and a Spearman correlation of 0.618 between teachers' competencies and use of software tools, implying that teachers' level of competencies increases as they use and employ software tools when teaching. The chi-square test statistic indicated results of 288.498 and a significance of P<0.005. The P value is less than the chosen significance level α = 0.05, which checks for independence on the teachers' competencies on ICT implementation. Therefore, implying that the null hypothesis was rejected at the 5% level of testing. The conclusion was that there is significant evidence that teachers' competencies significantly influence ICT implementation. Therefore, this study forms a foundation informing all universities stakeholders on their responsibility to support teachers in implementing technology in their instruction.  © 2022 Timothy Bariu et al.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have transformed the global outlook for international higher education. Given the rapid shift to online learning, the Tokyo Convention in the Asia-Pacific entrusted to UNESCO has become an important policy framework to facilitate regional collaboration, authoritative information sharing and recognition of qualifications across diverse modes of learning. This paper examines the role of the Tokyo Convention to establish an inclusive platform for monitoring and collaborative governance of mobility and internationalization based on fair and transparent recognition policies and practices in the Asia-Pacific. Design/methodology/approach: In August 2019, a standardized survey instrument was sent by the Secretariat of the Tokyo Convention Committee at UNESCO Bangkok to competent recognition authorities in 46 countries in the Asia-Pacific, including the eight State Parties to the Tokyo Convention that ratified the Convention as of the reporting period. In total, qualitative data from n = 27 countries/states was received and analyzed to assess implementation of the Tokyo Convention throughout the region. The research design illustrates how normative instruments such as the Tokyo Convention are monitored and assessed over time. Findings: A multi-stakeholder approach based on collaborative governance is needed to effectively monitor implementation and implications of the Tokyo Convention for diverse higher education stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific region. Research limitations/implications: Implications include establishing baseline data and methods for monitoring implementation of the Tokyo Convention. Based on collaborative governance theory, the paper explores potential for a multi-stakeholder approach to promote mutual accountability in the Asia-Pacific and to develop mechanisms for inclusive participation in the governance of the forthcoming Global Convention on recognition. Originality/value: As the first systematic review of its kind, this paper includes a unique dataset and insights into UNESCO's methodology to monitor implementation of standard-setting instruments for qualifications recognition in the Asia-Pacific. © 2021, Wesley R.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The paper aims to contributes on the debates about University Idea Incubation by investigating the role and the engagement of different University's stakeholders in the process of opportunity recognition in an entrepreneurship education program targeted at students with an interdisciplinary background. Design/methodology/approach: Through a longitudinal case study methodology, the Contamination Lab at University of Salento (Lecce, Italy), the learning approaches and the knowledge process to create an entrepreneurial awareness, mindset and capability in students with different educational background are presented. Findings: The findings demonstrates the crucial role of stakeholders' engagement for business idea presentation, open innovation challenge, contamination workshop on specialized topics, enterprise projects are important vehicle for effective students' business ideas and innovative projects development in a multidisciplinary environment. The close interaction among students, academia, companies and institutions creates a favourable environment that enables opportunity identification, idea generation through a deep contamination of knowledge, skills and experiences. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include the need to generalise the results even if this limitation is typical of the case study methodology. Other research is necessary for an in-depth analysis in deep of the other Contamination Lab in Italy and to derive the “invariance traits” of this environment according to the features of the local entrepreneurial ecosystems. Practical implications: Implications for practices include recommendations for designing innovative programs where the interactions between University-Institutions-Industry are realized. Originality/value: A conceptual framework is proposed by defining all the entrepreneurial knowledge process and knowledge creation within the Contamination Lab, highlighting the contribution of the stakeholders in each phase and learning initiative of the program. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: In this paper the constructs of a proposed questionnaire that assess the university stakeholders attributes (power, legitimacy and urgency) are validated. From a subjective perspective and a relational approach, the perceptions of a sample of public universities leaders from Manizales (Colombia) were collected. Two groups of constructs were formed, the first includes the university stakeholders attributes mentioned above and the second collects their relevance. The Cronbach alpha values indicate that is feasible to measure effectively the proposed constructs. It is concluded that, from an individual level of analysis, the proposed questionnaire has the internal consistency and the measure reliability for assessing the university stakeholders attributes. In this analysis, it is considered that the organizational context determines its stakeholders and that leaders' perceptions determine the relevance of the attributes.

ABSTRACT: Student drop-out is one of the most burning issues in STEM higher education, which induces considerable social and economic costs. Using machine learning tools for the early identification of students at risk of dropping out has gained a lot of interest recently. However, there has been little discussion on dropout prediction using interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools.In this work, using the data of a large public Hungarian university, we demonstrate how IML and XAI tools can support educational stakeholders in dropout prediction. We show that complex machine learning models – such as the CatBoost classifier – can efficiently identify at-risk students relying solely on pre-enrollment achievement measures, however, they lack interpretability. Applying IML tools, such as permutation importance (PI), partial dependence plot (PDP), LIME, and SHAP values, we demonstrate how the predictions can be explained both globally and locally. Explaining individual predictions opens up great opportunities for personalized intervention, for example by offering the right remedial courses or tutoring sessions. Finally, we present the results of a user study that evaluates whether higher education stakeholders find these tools interpretable and useful. © 2023, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: With the development of the human capital theory in the 1960s, education policy and its impact on societal advancement became an integral part of the economic policy. Under the assumptions that education leads to increased individual productivity, that earnings are a proxy for productivity (i.e., the more productive you are, the more you will earn, the more you earn, the more preferences one would satisfy and as such enhance your well-being), and that raising average and total incomes generate economic growth, education continues to translate into both a good individual investment and a key element of societal advancement. Regardless of how performance is defined, in an era of tight public budgets, it is not surprising that to bring private sector’s skills and control into higher education and to tap into private money was fathomed to represent the new panacea for improved efficiency and financial capacity. Attracting less controversy than privatization, attempting to recast the tension between the efficient and creative private sector and the bloated, stagnant public one, new management techniques are being introduced. Recognizing the fact that (higher)education and power are intertwined in a process of reciprocal legitimization is nothing new. Economically “parasitic,” universities have always relied on external sources of support, a support that brought to a varying extent also a certain degree of control from the sources of power in society, be it the church, the state or more recently the market. We believe that the idiographic focus on the qualitative hierarchical heterogeneity of the human psyche can enable us to conceive economics, education, and other social constructs alike in a holistic, multi-layered dynamic way, non-reducible, neither downwards to preferences/ behavioral linearity nor upwards, portraying individual as diluted into the collective, “the public.”. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to problems and upheaval throughout the higher-education sector, with university campuses ceasing face-to-face instruction and with assessments shifting to an online model for a few years. As a result, the pandemic prompted educators to teach online, utilizing online lectures, narrated power points, audio snippets, podcasts, instant messaging, and interactive videos, whereas traditional universities had primarily relied on in-person courses. Evaluations, which included assignments and multiple-choice questions, were conducted online, forcing lecturers to reconsider how deliverables were set up to prevent students from having easy access to the answers in a textbook or online. Learning from college students’ experiences throughout this time period will assist higher-education stakeholders (administration, faculty, and students) in adapting future online course delivery selections for higher education. In this study, we investigated the experiences of students learning from a distance, as well as aspects of their learning. We provide recommendations for higher education. The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly resulted in the largest distance-learning experiment in history. © 2022 by the authors.

The impact of self-development on the tendency toward organizational innovation in higher education institutions with the mediating role of human resource agility
(2022) Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education, 14 (2), pp. 852 - 873, Cited 4 times.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Considering innovation and its improvement as an essential strategy to enable organizations to continue their lives in the new competitive environment leads to a focus on employees' self-development as a factor that affects human resource agility (HRA) and the tendency toward organizational innovation. Consequently, the purpose of the study was to explain the impact of self-development on the tendency toward organizational innovation with the role of the mediator, HRA in higher education institutions as one of the most important and vital organizations in any society. Design/methodology/approach: The study was an applicable one with the quantitative approach using the descriptive–correlative method. The population consisted of 477 nonacademic employees of Kharazmi University among whom 214 ones were selected as the sample group, using a simple random sampling technique. Data were collected through the self-development, HRA and the tendency toward organizational innovation questionnaires and then analyzed using the structural equation modeling approach. Findings: The study findings revealed a positive impact of self-development on the HRA (γ = 0/79) and HRA on the tendency toward organizational innovation (β = 0/6). Also, self-development with mediating HRA impacts the tendency toward organizational innovation (β = 0/58). Finally, self-development had no direct impact on the tendency toward organizational innovation. Research limitations/implications: Taking the circumstances of doing this research into consideration, if there were the opportunity to do the research on the staffs of more than one university simultaneously and categorize the university staff into executives, managers and experts, more favorable results could be achieved. Also, considering group and organizational factors with the attention to the self-development approach and its factors would provide more awareness-training information on the higher education system in Iran. For future researches, both the individual and group factors are suggested to be surveyed and compared, to assess the weight and impact of these factors all together and to provide an adequate clarification of the role of the group and the organization. Finally, in future studies, it is also recommended that a qualitative approach be used to reach deeper clarifications on the aspects of these variables in the context of higher education. Practical implications: These findings have major practical implications concerning the higher educational settings. The findings of this study must give significant and practical insights for policymakers of universities and other higher education stakeholders, as well as recommendations to the academic community for further research in this area. First, they should recognize that nonacademic staff members are professional employees who contribute to improving organizational innovation. Higher education must focus on designing and implementing successful mechanisms and a well-planned self-development program that can help and promote the self-development approach among all staff. If the above-mentioned programs are designed based on the employees' needs analysis, they will get trained in a way to enhance mental and behavioral flexibility. The programs with such an approach can result in the proactive, adaptive, resilient behavior and agility of HR. Originality/value: The model for this study has integrated and prioritized the key innovation drivers that would help universities design, adopt and implement policies and practices that facilitate and encourage improvements and adaptation to a fast-paced environment. Furthermore, the convincing reason for the significance of the current research is that although several types of research have been carried out on each of these three variables in different contexts separately, very few studies, like this, have directly examined the correlation between these three variables among the non-academic staff in higher education institutes. So, given the importance of the issue and rare availability of evidence in this regard, the authors were intrigued to discover whether the self-development through the mediation of HRA could reinforce and strengthen the tendency toward organizational innovation and whether HRA could be an appropriate mediator of the relationship between self-development and the tendency toward organizational innovation among the nonacademic staff of Kharazmi University as one of the most prestigious and celebrated universities in Iran. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Despite the facts that higher education institutions are the source of quality concept and theory, they have been lagging behind manufacturing or service businesses in embracing and carrying out proper quality management. Managing quality in higher education is a difficult task due to several factors such as different perspectives between stakeholders and traditional characteristics of institutions. On the other hand, accreditation, for example by the Indonesian Bureau of Higher Education Accreditation, and international accreditation bodies, such as AACSB, EQUIS, is perceived as a tool to demonstrate a certain quality threshold. However, many studies argue that periodic quality assessments using recognized accreditation bodies do not touch inherent quality issues in education, and that they are generally used as an exercise of quality control. The objective of this study is to look beyond quality assessments using these recognized accreditation bodies and examine dimensions of quality from university’s stakeholder’s point of view, especially the stakeholder that represents the demand side. Factor analysis is conducted, and the number of factors proposed by the results are identified. There are seven quality dimensions that have impacts on the quality management system in higher education. Three dimensions are new findings, i.e., the importance of providing health and insurance, the importance of good ambiance of campus environment, and stakeholder’s explicit ability to demonstrate quality in higher education. © 2019, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

ABSTRACT: In contemporary higher education, stakeholder management is increasingly important given the growing number and complexity of stakeholder groups. Defensive stakeholder management (DSM), defined as verbal responses of universities to stakeholder criticism, is a largely neglected topic in the higher education literature. Drawing from a combination of theoretical perspectives in the organisation science literature, we explore how three Serbian universities engage with DSM (in relation to allegations of academic misconduct). We focus on the antecedents of inter-institutional differences in responses to stakeholder criticism and its antecedents, in particular, decision-making structures and core missions. Our findings suggest that different universities do respond differently to the same type of criticism and as such this is an important contribution to the debate on DSM in higher education and beyond. © 2017, © 2017 Society for Research into Higher Education.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to analyse the prevalence and effectiveness of methods and strategies for job searches amongst recent graduates of Russian universities. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis is carried out on data from the Russian Graduate Survey 2016, which is representative of individuals graduating during 2010–2015. The sample included 12,370 individuals. The empirical approach combined standard descriptive statistics, factor and regression analysis (multiple logit regression). Findings: Results show that the most common strategies are a combined strategy that involves the use of formal and informal methods, as well as “pure” informal strategies – applying to relatives and friends or contacting employers. The most effective strategies are job searches with the help of relatives and friends, by contacting employers and with the help of educational organisations. The choice of job search strategy is determined by the expected return in terms of the likelihood of finding a job. Practical implications: The paper increases understanding of graduate job search behaviour. The results can be used by multiple stakeholders in higher education to better prepare students for job seeking. Originality/value: This research, based on a large field survey of recent university graduates, provides the first estimates of use of job search strategies and their effectiveness for Russian university graduates. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Advances in technology and a shifting demographic of post-graduate students have resulted in a larger than ever number of off-campus PhD students. These students tend to be less satisfied than their on-campus counterparts with their candidature experience. Improving the current situation requires effort from multiple university stakeholders, including academic middle managers, who play a role in allocating resources and setting research training agenda. However, with the intensification of academic workload, academic managers might not view the support of off-campus PhD students as a high priority. This study investigates the attitudes of middle managers in a large Australian university concerning the provision of training and support to off-campus PhD students. The findings reveal that a complex interplay of discourses hinder the provision of support to off-campus PhD students. Implications for practice are discussed. © 2017 HERDSA.

ABSTRACT: Purpose – As higher education continues to be buffeted by challenges, college and university leaders must find a way to respond to these environmental forces. In the United States, accreditation plays an increasing role in the quality control and improvement process. The goal of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of this decision environment, and the stakeholders within that system, such that American higher education institutions may set and achieve goals more effectively. Research methodology – Grounded theory is utilized to create a conceptual framework depicting the American higher education stakeholder system. In addition to placing the actors within the system, this research is also designed to generate a stakeholder-focused institutional decision process model. Findings – When viewed in a systemic context, the accreditation process assumes a unique placement among the other critical stakeholders. With this understanding, higher education leaders may better understand, balance, and integrate the concerns of their various stakeholders, in a stakeholder-focused decision process. Research limitations – While integrating multiple theories, to depict the American higher education stakeholder system and a stakeholder-focused decision process, this research does not operationalize or undertake the empirical testing of these theoretical models. Practical implications – The influence of the dynamic external environment and the accreditation process combine to create extremely challenging decision-making conditions for higher education leaders. The ability to improve and balance the quality and ethical nature of decisions that impact their various stakeholders may assist these leaders in more accurately meeting both their institutional goals and the public good goals of higher education. Originality/Value – This study specifically seeks to integrate multiple theoretical constructs within the American higher education environment and accreditation process. The creation of a theoretical model that depicts not only the stakeholder environment but also a stakeholder-focused decision process may assist all higher education institutions. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Previous research has conceptualized and investigated internationalization of higher education in relatively stable and peaceful environments. Studies on internationalization in the context of war are largely absent. Using interviews and survey responses from Ukrainian professors and administrators affected by the Russian invasion of 2014–2022, this paper re-examines the premises of internationalization, and outlines key dilemmas facing universities in times of existential crisis. The study reveals that the transformative powers of crisis-driven internationalization redefine ontological and axiological foundations of universities. University stakeholders readjust their responsibilities to reduce human vulnerability, while international solidarity helps them mitigate fragility in the war-affected academia. © 2023 HERDSA.

ABSTRACT: EU-Russia higher education cooperation has continued despite global tensions including Crimea incorporation. One example of this cooperation is the development of Finnish-Russian double degree programmes. This paper focuses on institutional environments where double degrees develop and asks how and why they produce uncertainty from inside Finnish and Russian universities in the period of this unfavourable political situation. The matryoshka model is applied to understand the institutional environment of a university and the institutions around it. The institutional nature of a double degree is determined by comparative analysis of how internal university stakeholders in Finland and Russia perceive a programme’s benchmarks. The study is based on the analysis of interviews conducted in partner universities. This paper discusses how perceptions of double degrees influence uncertainty in programme provision within and between institutional environments in Finnish and Russian universities. In addition, the level of institutionalisation of the double degrees may be evaluated. © 2018, © 2018 Association for Tertiary Education Management and the LH Martin Institute for Tertiary Education Leadership and Management.

ABSTRACT: A university has many stakeholders with varying interests and commitments. Several studies have examined modes and methods of HEIs communication with stakeholders. To the best of our knowledge, it is not evident in the literature how the engagement between universities and their stakeholders proceeds on the social media platforms particularly from a developing country perspective. This study employed stakeholder theory to give newer understanding to social media marketing as a strategy to reach university stakeholders and utilised an inductive, generic, qualitative approach in a netnography context to achieve the aim of this study. Theoretically, this chapter makes three key contributions. First, it extends the knowledge of the use of social media by universities, moving beyond the use of websites as strategic, interactive stakeholder engagement tools. Second, the study extends the application of stakeholder theory to include university conversations on social media, especially regarding the higher education institutions from a developing country perspective. Third, while acknowledging the unique and dynamic nature of stakeholders on social media, the study adopts a unique methodology to capture the usage of social media by the universities and explored their level of activity and analysed stakeholder responses. Methodologically, the study contributes to the literature on social media research. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Emmanuel Mogaji, Felix Maringe, and Robert Ebo Hinson; individual chapters, the contributors.

ABSTRACT: This study presents a qualification programme on research-based learning for early stage researchers and its perception. In conclusion, the foremost aim of the programme, that is introducing research-based learning, has been reached in an acceptingly manner. Still, attempts for enhancement on the three individual levels reaction, learning, and behaviour have been recently realized by an improved qualification programme and will be evaluated soon. However, implementing research-based learning clearly faces substantial obstacles in regard to disciplinary and institutional characteristics, among others. As a consequence, this requires additional in-depth investigations of the results on the institutional level, and identification of the profound barriers and potentials for research-based learning experienced by various university stakeholders. Adjusting those findings with prerequisites of higher engineering education could help to overcome barriers cooperatively. To do so, recommendations by participants can serve as a first source to take actions. To summarise, qualifying early stage researchers proved to be a promising approach to integrate research into teaching and learning as part of a comprehensive institutional strategy towards modern higher engineering education. © Proceedings of the 46th SEFI Annual Conference 2018: Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Engineering Education Excellence.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore, from the perspective of a medium-sized academic library, how libraries can pursue and use collaboration with other units on campus to increase support and buy-in for digital collections. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is approached from the perspective of a medium-sized academic library located in Alabama, USA. This study examines ways to foster collaboration with diverse campus units, the challenges that can be encountered and ways to overcome these barriers to collaboration. Examples of the potential and realized benefits are also enumerated. Findings: This paper demonstrates that, while there are challenges that must be overcome, regular and sustained collaboration with nonlibrary campus units can result in the creation of unique digital collections that such units are not capable of pursuing without library partnership. These partnerships increase visibility for the library and its services, as well as buy-in and support for digital collections from other campus units and, importantly, university administration. Practical implications: Academic libraries, especially those at small- to medium-sized institutions, face continual budget restrictions and calls to justify the resources expended. This impacts all aspects of library services, but especially the creation of digital collections, which are cost- and labor-intensive. By offering examples of collaboration, libraries can explore ways to partner that will foster buy-in and support at their own institutions. Originality/value: This paper provides examples and details considerations that can make the process of collaboration simpler and more effective for other academic libraries to pursue. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This study aims to investigate the relationship between university rankings and sustainability reporting among Australia and New Zealand universities. Even though sustainability reporting is an established area of investigation, prior research has paid inadequate attention to the nexus of university ranking and sustainability reporting. Design/methodology/approach: This study covers 46 Australian and New Zealand universities and uses a data set, which includes sustainability reports and disclosures from four reporting channels including university websites, and university archives, between 2005 and 2018. Ordinary least squares regression was used with Pearson and Spearman’s rank correlations to investigate the likelihood of multi-collinearity and the paper also calculated the variance inflation factor values. Finally, this study uses the generalized method of moments approach to test for endogeneity. Findings: The findings suggest that sustainability reporting is significantly and positively associated with university ranking and confirm that the four reporting channels play a vital role when communicating with university stakeholders. Further, this paper documents that sustainability reporting through websites, in addition to the annual report and a separate environment report have a positive impact on the university ranking systems. Originality/value: This paper contributes to extant knowledge on the link between university rankings and university sustainability reporting which is considered a vital communication vehicle to meet the expectation of the stakeholder in relevance with the university rankings. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Higher education reform efforts in Ecuador during the last decade have been described as a process that has radically shaped local institutions. With the government at the forefront of mandating this reform, we examined the perspectives of stakeholders in the country who have been charged with enacting policies seeking to improve higher education. Findings suggested that stakeholders who engaged with the reform understood the need for policy changes and were committed to improve higher education. However, they viewed the reform as an imposed process and have criticized the lack of opportunities to provide input pertaining to the implementation of policy mandates. Under a highly regulated government reform context, university stakeholders felt lost translating national policy guidelines into plans at the institutional level and felt their roles were undervalued and minimized throughout the policy implementation process. We argue Ecuador must seek to include more voices to enhance reform implementation, reassess current policy goals and timelines, and nurture reform stakeholders as policy implementers to reap the benefits of this reform process. © 2019, International Association of Universities.

Characterization of Spanish Universities behavior in relation to the disclosure of intangibles [Caracterización del comportamiento de las Universidades Españolas en relación con la divulgación de informaciónsobre intangibles]
(2013) Revista de Estudios Regionales, (97), pp. 15 - 49, Cited 4 times.

ABSTRACT: In the actual knowledge-based economy, the presentation of information about intellectual capital becomes of prime importance in institutions of higher education, mainly because knowledge is the main output and input of these institutions. Universities produce knowledge, either through scientific and technical research (the results of investigation, publications etc.) or through teaching (students trained and productive relationships with their stakeholders). Their most valuable resources also include their teachers, researchers, administration and service staff, university governors and students, with all their organizational relationships and routines. It is true to say then that universities' input and output are largely intangible. Moreover, the current interest and increasing social concern for establishing procedures of accountability and to ensure information transparency in public institutions of higher education prompted us to raise the need to disclose information on their intellectual capital. In this situation, the major objective of this study was to identify which is the positioning of Spanish public universities on the necessity of disclosing information on their intellectual capital. To this end, a questionnaire was designed and sent to the members of the Social Council of Spanish public universities in order to identify what intangible elements university stakeholders demand most, and what behavioral patterns present the Spanish universities regarding the importance they attribute to the disclosure of intellectual capital. It was thought that these participants would provide a good example of the attitude of university stakeholders since they represent the different social groups connected with universities. To achieve the objectives set in the study, those surveyed were asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale the importance they gave to universities publishing information on the different intangible elements by Spanish public universities (related to human, structural and relational capital). Specifically, based on the Intellectus Model (CIC, 2003), we proposed 32 intangible elements according to the higher education institutions' characteristics, in order to establish their relevance for disclosing: twelve relating to human capital (concerning the abilities and skills of the people belonging to the institutions), fourteen relating to structural capital (these referring to how the institution is structured and how it works), and sixteen relating to relational capital (that reflect the institution's relations with students and the outside world). The obtained replies were subjected to a descriptive analysis based on the characteristics of each of the questions. Also, a cluster analysis has also been applied in order to know the priorities of the Spanish public universities in terms of reporting on certain intangibles, identifying profiles of universities. The results obtained in the empirical study show the great importance that the stakeholders give to the disclosure of the intellectual capital in universities. Specifically, it is considered essential the disclosure of the following intangible elements: academic and professional qualifications of the teaching and research staff, scientific productivity, efficiency of human capital, and teaching and research capacities and competences (Human Capital); management quality and intellectual property (Structural Capital); as well as the student satisfaction, graduate employability, relations with the business world, and the university's image (Relational Capital). Second, our research is focused on detecting patterns of behavior of Spanish universities related to the importance they attach to the disclosure of intellectual capital. In this sense, the results reveal three different positions on the subject: 1) universities proactive towards the presentation of all information on intellectual capital, specifically on the competencies and skills of university staff; 2) universities whose stakeholders attach greater importance to information on structural capital, specifically on quality of management and technological innovation processes; and, 3) universities adopt a middle position in this regard. Finally, we have tried to know the priorities of different stakeholders of the Spanish public universities in relation to reporting on certain specific intangible items (12 items representing human capital, 14 items about structural capital and 16 items about relational capital), bringing together universities with similar characteristics. In this regard, in all cases three distinct groups of universities have been identified. In our opinion, and considering the results of the empirical study carried out, it is absolutely necessary for universities to disclose information on their intangibles through the filing of an intellectual capital report. It will be a healthy exercise of transparency from these institutions to provide users with access to this type of information, which is relevant for decision making. Now one of the basic premises is that intellectual capital is specific to each organization and its value and relevance depends on its potential contribution to the key objectives of the institution, so there is no homogeneous pattern of reporting on capital intellectual of universities. In this sense, based on the results of our empirical study and in order to obtain a balance between standardization and idiosyncrasies of each university, our work suggests: first, that all Spanish universities should provide information on a set of basic and general intangibles which are useful for all the institutions (in particular, we have identified thirteen intangible elements considered essential), and second, that every university should present a set of specific intangible elements of the institution who would be selected by every university, serving the demands of their stakeholders. In this sense, our work represents a starting point for each Spanish university to individually identify which information about intellectual capital is the most demanded by its stakeholders, and therefore to develop an intellectual capital report according to their own characteristics and environment. Taken together, the results obtained in our research do not only advance the research into stakeholders' expectations in the university community, but also offer useful and specific guidelines for intellectual capital reporting practice in Spanish universities. From our point of view, the creation of an open framework of intellectual capital reporting, but with some homogeneous categories to ensure consistency and comparison, can enable new and exciting possibilities.

ABSTRACT: Background: Teaching-focused faculty positions have grown in popularity in higher education and provide novel opportunities to transform undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. The University of California (UC) system employs a unique teaching-focused faculty position, officially called the Lecturer with Potential Security of Employment (L(P)SOE), with the working title called Professor of Teaching (PoT). The UC PoT position is a tenure-track position with teaching as the primary tenure expectation. We present findings from interviews with stakeholder faculty in STEM departments at three UC campuses to identify reasons for hiring PoT, capture accomplishments of PoT in their departments and disciplinary fields, and identify potential barriers to PoT success. Results: Overall, this study highlights stakeholder’s perspectives on the value of teaching-focused faculty in research-intensive universities. Stakeholders described the goals for hiring Professors of Teaching, which included easing the burden of teaching responsibilities of the departments and adding consistency of instruction. While the stakeholders expressed that PoT were meeting the goals for being hired, they also identified many barriers for PoT being fully integrated and successful. The stakeholders expressed concern about unclear and unfair expectations related to tenure and promotion. Conclusions: The findings point to a general undervaluing and underappreciation of teaching-focused faculty and suggest that in order for PoT to have a positive impact on STEM higher education, they need more support and inclusion from their colleagues and institutions. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Church-affiliated universities operate with increasingly complex roles and functions when engaging with multiple stakeholders in the provision of higher education. This article asks how to understand and analyse the interactions when these universities are among the multiple stakeholders in Christian teacher education. What frameworks of analysis or tools of evaluation can be employed? Stakeholder theory is shown to support the identification of various community interests and involvements and enable clarification of whose perspective or priorities are to be taken into account. From a recent UK research case study, the need for greater understanding and management of stakeholder interests and activity within Christian teacher education is highlighted. © The Author(s) 2019.

ABSTRACT: Higher education institutions (HEIs) are facing increasing pressure embracing institutional change towards the adoption of sustainable development (SD). Responding to the growing demands, several articles have been published presenting integration of SD principles in higher education policies and practices. A review of such articles published during the decade of education for sustainable development is presented in this paper. The paper also studied stakeholder engagement in sustainability integration process in university curriculum, campus operations, research, outreach and reporting. The findings revealed that most of the published articles focus on courses and curriculum with little research in sustainability reporting, though deemed to be the most critical factor dealing with stakeholder interests. Moreover, the papers concentrated on internal stakeholders undermining the role of external stakeholders in higher education for sustainable development. The paper suggests a paradigm shift towards engaging each and every stakeholder in the integration process of sustainable development in HEIs. Furthermore, the research contributes to the existing literature on higher education for sustainable development (HESD) by mere structural changes and proposes a deliberate endeavour to focus stakeholders’ intrinsic behavioural factors for expeditious and holistic implementation of sustainable development across HEIs.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to uncover the key determinants and indicators that have the potential to demonstrate the success level of higher education institutions (HEIs). Although some criteria and mechanisms for internal and external evaluation of HEIs are widely accepted, it is still necessary to adapt them and develop mechanisms for a more detailed institution-level performance assessment. This survey-based research empirically validated a model of key determinants and performance indicators of HEIs as perceived by teachers and teaching assistants from four major universities in Croatia (N = 619). In line with the current practice in Croatia, Strategy and quality planning, Organization and improvement of educational processes, Collaboration and scientific research, and Financial and other resources were extracted as key determinants. As expected with regards to performance indicators, the respondents deem enrolment and graduation rates of bachelor, master and doctorate studies as the most important indicators but also emphasize the importance of process-related indicators such as accreditation, standardization and cooperation. All HEIs in Croatia can evaluate this set of determinants and indicators according to their own context and use it to design and develop a comprehensive model for monitoring and tracking their performance and reporting to various stakeholders, and ultimately to implement an institution-wide performance management system.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Higher education and universities have faced unprecedented and ubiquitous changes. The University of Tehran or “UT,” as the leading university in Iran, is not immune to these changes. The purposes of this study is to investigate the current situation and future of the UT and gain insights and possible responses to changes that suit its strengths and potential to progress in an increasingly competitive, complex environment with uncertainties. It identifies deep fundamental underpinnings of the issue and highlights them for policymakers to formulate strategies and future vision of the UT. Design/methodology/approach: Causal layered analysis (CLA) was applied as a framework and the data collected from different sources such as literature reviews, content analysis of rules, regulations and master plans of the university and coded interviews of four different groups of university stakeholders were analyzed. The current system of UT, as well as hidden beliefs, that maintains traditional perceptions about university was mapped. Next, by applying a new recursive process and reverse CLA order, new CLA layers extracted through an expert panel, the layers of CLA based on new metaphors to envision future of UT were backcasted. Findings: The results from CLA layers including litany, system, worldview and metaphor about the current statue of UT show disinterest and inertia against changes, conservative, behind the times and traditional perceptions, and indicate that the UT system is mismatched to the needs of society and stakeholders in the future. The authors articulated alternative perspectives deconstructed from other worldviews so there are new narratives that reframe the issues at hand. The results show that to survive in this fast-paced revolution and competition in higher education, UT should develop scenarios and formulate new strategies. Research limitations/implications: The authors had limited access to a wide range of stakeholders. As the UT is a very big university with so many faculties and departments, to access a pool of experts and top policymakers who were so busy and did not have time to interview inside and outside of university was very hard for the research team. The authors also had limitation to access the internal enactments and decisions of the trustee board of the UT and the financial balance sheets of the university. Originality/value: In this paper, by mixing different methods of futures studies, the authors have shown how to move forward while understanding the perspectives of stakeholders about the future of UT by a new recursive process and reverse CLA order. A supplementary phase was added to improve CLA and to validate the method and results, which were ignored in previous studies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Most research states that implementing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) has positive impacts. However, fewer studies have discussed ESG implementation in higher education. This study aimed to develop instruments to assess the ESG atmosphere in higher education institutions. A modified Delphi approach was employed. Experts were invited from a private higher education institution in Indonesia. A deductive study, discussion, and two stages of getting consensus from panelists were conducted. The instrument was distinguished into four types for four groups of higher education stakeholders: Students, Staff, Faculty Members, and Community Members. The I-CVIs ranged from 0.80–1.00, while the minimum values of S-CVI/Ave and S-CVI/UA were 0.98 and 0.91, respectively, meaning the content validity was excellent. The final version instrument has been tested and declared valid, reliable, and ready to be used for empirical research for universities to assess their contribution to the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). There are also opportunities to conduct further research on the existence of recursive and non-recursive models between factors. © 2022 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: In the last several years, disasters - both man-made and natural - have taken their toll on college campuses. Extant research shows that college campuses have greatly increased their emergency management efforts. One area in which colleges and universities have made strides is emergency management communication. There has been some research examining emergency management communication across campuses, but there is still much to learn. This research fills a gap in this area by investigating the use of university Web sites to disseminate emergency management information to the university stakeholders. Data were gathered in 2007 and 2014 from the Web sites of public, 4-year universities in Indiana. The results show that universities are using the Internet to communicate emergency management information to their stakeholders. Among the most common categories of information available on the Web sites are links to other agencies, university response information, and threat levels. Implications for future research are discussed. © 2016, Weston Medical Publishing. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This study uses Black feminist thought to explore the experiences of Black women faculty that earned tenure and promotion to associate professor. We found that participants who reported positive experiences on the tenure track received strong support from various sources. Conversely, those devoid of competent support consistently reported negative experiences. Collectively, our participants’ narratives offer insight into the importance of mentoring and departmental leadership to support Blackwomen junior faculty’s well-being and potential career contributions. Based on our theoretical considerations and findings, we argue for more robust mentoring and support policy and praxis for Black women faculty that requires broader investment and participation from university stakeholders at all levels. Finally, we close with directions for future research. © 2022. National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education

ABSTRACT: This paper looks at the interplay between ‘creative industries’ and ‘cultural policy’ in France. We analyse how university stakeholder communities in the field of elite vocational training schools for ‘applied arts’ such as Bande dessinée (comics and animation) and videogaming negotiate the over simplistically reified relationship between public policies in the arts and the creative sector. The analysis relates the ‘case-studies’ of the ENJMIN (a national videogames school in Angoulême) to the long-standing French technocratic traditions of creating elite graduate schools in all fields of public policy, and, increasingly, in the creative sector. The study assesses the tension between the speed of response of policy in a rapidly changing economic environment and the creation of institutions that are supportive and respective and can deliver in a sustainable and substantial way. The paper explores how French policy manages the conflict between complex HE institutions involving loosely coupled communities with varying degrees of mutual commitment and self-identification and the creative industries as a complex, politically charged, and often emotionally laden field. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

ABSTRACT: It is not rare to read positive comments about North American higher education from higher education stakeholders in Europe, particularly policy-makers and institutional managers. The aspects of the system which are most often praised are the degree of institutional competition and the benefits this brings in terms of institutional flexibility, responsiveness, and adaptability. Moreover, those voices also enhance the resourcefulness of North American higher education institutions in finding alternative sources of funding to cope with the steady decline in public funding. In recent decades European higher education has felt the impact of the aforementioned trends and the effects have been not altogether dissimilar from the ones identified in North American higher education. Moreover, the growing integration of European higher education systems has also contributed to enhance some convergence with some of the trends identified in the American case. In this paper, we reflect on the impact of the increasing marketization of funding and governance mechanisms on the European higher education landscape and compare it with the impact of those trends discussed in the papers by Irwin Feller and George W. Breslauer. © Copyright 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: This article reports findings from an institutional ethnography of university stakeholders’ writing in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, illustrating the affordances of this methodology for professional and technical communication. Drawing on interview transcripts with faculty and administrators from across the university, the authors contextualize the role of writing in the iterative, collaborative, distributed writing processes by which the university transitioned from a traditional A–F grading scheme to a pass or fail option in just a few business days. They analyze these stakeholders’ experiences, discussing some effects of this accelerated timeline on policy development, writing processes, and uses of writing technologies within this new context of remote teaching and learning. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: This study examines the relationship between family rejection and moderate to severe psychological distress during COVID-19 among LGBTQ university students. Data were obtained from a national cross-sectional electronic survey of LGBTQ university students (N = 565) collected in the summer of 2020. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine the predictive association between increased family rejection and moderate to severe psychological distress. Respondents who reported increased rejection were more than twice as likely to report moderate to severe psychological distress, with social isolation and LGBTQ identity concealment being significant covariate predictors in the model. These results demonstrate the importance of public health, medical, mental health, and higher education stakeholders understanding the significance of LGBTQ-identity related family rejection when addressing the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ young people. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: As a pioneer study on academic leadership efficacy in university context, this mixed-method study aimed at exploring the association between dean leadership efficacy in the areas of action efficacy and self-regulation efficacy and the faculty level of self-efficacy in terms of teaching and research at a public university in Afghanistan. The study employed a mixed-method design to collect the required data in two different phases. First, two sets of questionnaires were used to collect the quantitative data. Second, semi-structured interviews were conducted with six faculty members to investigate their perceptions of dean leadership and the faculty efficacy so as to triangulate the quantitative results. The total participants of this study were 126 faculty members (120 for quantitative and 6 for qualitative). The results showed the dean leaders were perceived to have a medium level of leadership efficacy and the faculty were also reported with almost the same level of teaching efficacy but low level of research efficacy. A significant positive association was also found between the dean leaders and the faculty members’ levels of efficacy in leadership, teaching and research. Accordingly, universities’ stakeholders were addressed with certain implications about dean leadership as well as the faculty levels of efficacy. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Like many university cities, Champaign, Illinois, has recently experienced a surge in student housing in its Campustown neighborhood, with 25 developments and over 2500 new housing units built from 2008 to 2019. Four of the new buildings exceed 10 stories, far denser and more imposing than the Campustown of only two decades ago. The local conventional wisdom holds that this growth resulted from loosened zoning restrictions, an explanation we reject. Instead, our interviews and document analysis reveal a more complex interplay of infrastructure investment, university enrolment policies, developer decision-making, and investment capital. Our analysis shows how government, developer, and university stakeholders interacted with one another in what Norton Long called the local ecology of games, updating Campustown into a student dormitory for a larger and more elite student body. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Global rankings help boost the international reputation of universities, which thus attempt to achieve good positions on them. These rankings attract great interest each year and are followed attentively by stakeholders in higher education. This paper investigates the trajectory of Spanish universities in the ARWU and THE rankings over the last 5 years using the dynamic biplot technique to study the relationship between a multivariate dataset obtained at more than one time point. The results demonstrate that Spanish universities achieve low positions on international rankings when analyzed using this multivariate and dynamic approach. Indeed, only a small percentage occupy good positions in both studied rankings and stand out in terms of some of the indicators, whereas most achieve weak scores in the global context. Spanish universities should attempt to improve this situation, since the prestige resulting from a good position on these lists will always be beneficial in terms of the visibility of both the universities themselves and the whole Spanish university system. © 2021, El Profesional de la Informacion.

ABSTRACT: Whole university approaches to student mental health and well-being increasingly involve university counselling and mental health services (UCMHSs) as key stakeholders in higher education and the fulfilment of good academic outcomes. However, previous research using routine outcome measures has focussed on psychological distress only. Research is needed to demonstrate the value of university counselling on academic outcomes. This study aimed at profiling the psychological distress of a student sample according to the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation—Outcome Measure (CORE-OM); measuring the change in perceived impact of problems on academic outcomes, and measuring the perceived impact of counselling on academic outcomes. Students from two UK university counselling services completed the CORE-OM and the Counselling Impact on Academic Outcomes (CIAO) questionnaire as part of routine practice. After counselling, 67.4% (n = 323) of students with planned endings to counselling showed at least reliable improvement on the CORE-OM. Significant reductions in the perceived impact of problems on all academic outcomes were also found. On average, 83% (n = 398) of students found counselling helpful for academic outcomes to at least a limited extent. University counselling was found to reduce psychological distress and the impact of problems on academic outcomes. Psychometric examination of the CIAO tool is warranted to strengthen its use. The need for robust data across UCMHSs is demonstrated by both the strengths and limitations of this study. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This article argues for the importance of taking into account stakeholders’ beliefs and perceptions about teaching and learning foreign languages and CLIL, as they can be regarded as a pre-condition for the implementation of CLIL as a new pedagogical approach and finally for determining the success of teaching and learning through CLIL in the given context. The research was placed within a mixed research paradigm and relied on data obtained through the application of the QUAL-QUAN model, employing semi-structured interviews with administrators and surveys among 15 teachers and 207 students. Qualitative data underwent a two-step coding process: open coding and axial coding. Quantitative data from questionnaires were processed through two applications: SurveyMonkey and SPSS. Descriptive statistics were calculated. SPSS was used to identify the degree of association between different variables by cross-tabulating the results. Overall, the findings conclude that both teachers and students showed a high awareness of successful EFL teaching and learning practices, which provided them with more confidence and motivation for the application of CLIL as a new approach. © Centre for Language Studies National University of Singapore.

ABSTRACT: Research in fast-evolving technologies like AI ML requires the collaborative effort of various stakeholders including industries and universities. In developed economies, industry-university collaboration (IUC) is mature and delivers benefits to both stakeholders. In a developing nation like India, there is relatively less emphasis on IUC and when present, is restricted to a small set of premier institutions. At the undergraduate level, the collaboration between industry and university is very minimal to none. This poses major challenges to industry (insufficient qualified talent pool, higher cost of training fresh recruits, limited choice of external research partners) as well as universities (curriculum lagging latest technology, not reaching full research and innovation potential, source for research funding). This paper summarizes the IUC effort undertaken by Intel Technology India Ltd and the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at PES University to create mutually rewarding outcomes for both partners and describes a new model encompassing technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship in addition to the traditional elements of IUC. We present the IUC considerations and processes adopted to deal with the challenges and share the outcomes and impact at the end of two years of engagement and hope that key aspects of this IUC can be leveraged by other industry and university stakeholders for mutually rewarding outcomes. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: The nature of community–campus engagement varies widely across the United States, but is recognizably present at a majority of higher education institutions. The particular flavor of community engagement initiatives is shaped by the institutional purposes they serve, how faculty and students are introduced to the concept of engaged scholarship, and the type of support available to the various stakeholders involved. These “flavors” of engagement could otherwise be described as orientations. There are orientations of engagement that reify the existing cultures, structures, power dynamics, and ways of valuing knowledge within higher education and communities, and there are orientations that challenge these normative ideas. Examples of orientations that would challenge the status quo include a democratic orientation (Kliewer, 2013; Saltmarsh, Hartley, & Clayton, 2009), a critical or justice-oriented stance (Mitchell, 2008; Tinkler, 2010), or a participatory approach (Greenwood, Whyte, & Harkavy, 1993; Minkler & Wallerstein, 2003). Community engagement professionals (CEPs) are charged with administrating the implementation of community engagement and are in a central position to shape the synergy between institutional priorities, values, and the engagement strategies that are developed; stress certain orientations of engagement to which faculty and students are introduced; and sculpt the support they offer and the approach they take to working with others (e.g., faculty, students, community partners, and institutional leaders). The professional associations they and other university stakeholders consult also shape the orientation of engagement at their respective campuses. This chapter makes visible the effect of these professionalizing influences, which include associations and professional staff positions, and emphasizes a need for more research in this area. Engagement Associations: Divergent Orientations Of the numerous organizations and associations that support the use of community engagement, there are six that have arguably been the major influences on institutions of higher education across America and for which community engagement is the entire focus of the organization: the National Society for Experiential Education (NSEE), Community-Campus Partnerships for Health (CCPH), Campus Compact (in the form of a national organization and thirty-four state affiliate organizations), the Engaged Scholarship Consortium (previously named the National Outreach Scholarship Consortium), the International Association for Research on Service-Learning and Community Engagement (IARSLCE), and Imagining America: Artists and Scholars in Public Life. © Cambridge University Press 2017.

ABSTRACT: Madrasah diniyah is a very special Islamic education system in Indonesia that can be implemented from primary, secondary, and even higher education levels. This study aimed to explain the integration of the madrasah system in Islamic Religious Universities in the framework of strengthening religious moderation. The research method used was qualitative with a symbolic interactionalism approach. The main informants in this study were eleven people from the elements of the chancellor, vice-rector 1, head of Madrasah diniyah (Mudhir), teachers/ustadz, and students at State Islamic Institute (IAIN) Tulungagung selected by purposive sampling technique. The research implementation procedure was technically carried out by the stages of data collection, reduction, presentation, and analysis. This study found that the integration of the Madrasah diniyah system into the learning system at IAIN Tulungagung is quite effective in increasing students' religious knowledge. The implementation of Madrasah diniyah needs the support of all stakeholders in higher education. The obstacles faced need to be minimized in terms of infrastructure improvement and participant readiness. The Madrasah diniyah system which is integrated into the learning system in universities is a breakthrough in the world of higher education. With the effective integration of the Madrasah diniyah system into the learning system at Islamic religious universities, the implementation of Madrasah diniyah requires the support of all stakeholders. Therefore, the Madrasah diniyah system integration model is a model that can be developed in other Islamic religious universities. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

ABSTRACT: This paper examines librarian-faculty collaboration in selected academic libraries in Lagos State, Nigeria. Simple random sampling method was used to select five out of a total population of nine higher institutions in Lagos State. Questionnaire was used as the major instrument for data gathering among librarians in the selected institutions. The study found that librarians are willing to collaborate with faculty in the areas of providing Current Awareness Services (CAS), working with accreditation teams, and helping to develop both the media and information literacy skills of students. The study also found that librarians believe that faculty board meetings and library committee initiatives are effective platforms for promoting librarian faculty collaboration. Further, the study identified essential skills for librarian-faculty collaboration. Overall, findings show that a weak negative correlation exists between gender and area of collaboration at N = 38, r = −0.136, p < 0.05. The survey also found a significant weak negative relationship between age and area of collaboration (N = 38, r = −0.379, p < 0.05). No significant relationship was found between work experience and area of collaboration (r = −0.067, p = 0.696 > 0.05). The study therefore suggests that stakeholders in higher education should imbibe the culture of expanding and strengthening collaboration between librarians and faculty. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Pathway decisions during the student-athlete transition out of university in the United Kingdom
(2022) Journal of Applied Sport Psychology, 34 (4), pp. 803 - 824, Cited 4 times.

ABSTRACT: The student-athlete transition out of university requires athletes to make important decisions regarding their future. However, there is no research that focuses on the pathways that athletes take when they leave university and the factors that underpin athletes’ decisions. The current study explored the pathways athletes take when they leave university in the United Kingdom (UK), and their reasons for taking these specific routes. Eleven elite UK former and current university student-athletes (M age = 21.4) from different sports were interviewed. Eight university stakeholders (e.g., head coaches, lifestyle advisor, performance sport manger) took part in a focus group. Data were thematically analyzed. Results suggest that athletes take four different pathways following university: (1) advancing onto a postgraduate education and elite sport pathway, (2) full-time sport pathway, (3) sport and work pathway, and (4) dropping out of sport and moving onto an alternative pathway. There were multiple factors that led athletes to taking each pathway. These included a desire to qualify for the next Olympic Games, having an education “safety net,” goal of advancing onto a funded sport programme, and limited work-sport dual career opportunities. This article advances previous work in athlete transitions and athlete career pathways, focusing specifically on a key career transition point for UK athletes. Support providers could use the findings to help athletes critically reflect on their motivations and future goals and come to a decision around what their most suitable pathway should be. Lay summary: We explored the experiences of UK student-athletes as they left university, including the factors that influence their decisions around what they do. Student-athletes were found to take four different routes and had different motives and reasons why they took the route that they did.Implications for Practice Practitioners should support athletes to critically reflect on their motivations and future goals when they are about to complete university and come to a decision around what their most suitable pathway should be. Risks of taking a make or break year as a full-time athlete after university without funding secured should be communicated to athletes. National governing bodies (NGBs) should consider more carefully how they can incorporate dual career opportunities into their centralized programmes. Universities are advised to offer postgraduate athlete support programmes. Parents, NGBs, and university stakeholders should use a collaborative approach to support the athlete to critically examine their opportunities post-university. © 2021 Association for Applied Sport Psychology.

ABSTRACT: Studio courses can transform practice and impart planning values, but increasing university expectations around revenue generation could create barriers for these objectives. To understand how funding demands could impact planning education, we examine a New Orleans–based case study in which external funders pressured university stakeholders to change a studio course. The studio, focused on environmental justice and freight rail planning, remained much the same, but shifted from an advocacy framework to a technical approach. This approach did little to impart social justice values or transform practice, but planning education can still support social justice values. © The Author(s) 2017.

The price of knowledge and the wisdom of innocence: A difficult journey through the employability discourse in higher education

ABSTRACT: Through the examination of knowledge artefacts, utilising an analytical metaphorical representation, the authors present an exploration of higher education. In this way, the exploration is depicted as a schizophrenic, dichotomic journey through the difficult discourse of knowledge, wisdom, and employability in higher education institutions. The article explores how the place and value of knowledge appear fractured in the higher education curriculum. Applying Root Cause Analysis, it is argued that the marketisation, commercialisation and commodification of higher education, with the resulting emphasis on economic value through the employability of graduates, has created unintended consequences in the sector. To insert employability initiatives, something has to give in the module structure so that everything can be fitted in. That ‘something’ is the sacrifice of wisdom within the deeper knowledge of a subject. The authors argue that the depth of knowledge has unintentionally been negatively affected by embedding employability. While some students position themselves strategically to use their education for their individual gain, others want to learn more deeply, and become anxious that they do not have the time to reflect on what they have learned. It is recommended that a deeper reflexive conversation must take place between all stakeholders in higher education if it is to have a future in economic terms. © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Purpose – The purpose of this research paper is to look at the overall instructional performance of academic librarians in Sri Lanka and shed light on the challenges and potential problems facing the implementation of quality information literacy (IL) in university libraries. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected by means of a questionnaire, which was sent to all professional academic librarians working in Sri Lankan university libraries. The results were analyzed using frequency and percentage distributions. Findings – The results reveal that the organizational structures of academic libraries do not clearly acknowledge the academic librarians’ role in library instruction. Though most academic libraries had formal instruction policies, the majority had not appointed instruction coordinators. Academic librarians were not satisfied with the assessment of their teaching by library administrators, even though most of them had teaching experience. Most of the user education programs which they practiced were not up-to-date. Academic librarians’ interest and positive attitudes with regard to library instruction, particularly for IL was the other significant factor explored by the study. Research limitations/implications – The study focuses only on academic librarians. The exclusion of other university stakeholders such as teaching staff, students, administrators and others from the study poses a significant limitation. Originality/value – The results of this study can be generalized to academic libraries in Sri Lanka and to academic libraries in other developing countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to create a conceptual framework to demonstrate the role of universities as knowledge partners in place branding networks. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts a case study strategy to explore the perceptions of institutional and community stakeholders in Northamptonshire. The objective is to examine the regional activities and engagement of a single-player university in a peripheral region and explore its potential for widening stakeholder participation. Qualitative data was collected through interviews and focus groups and thematically analysed. Findings: The university played a complementary “partnership” role to other institutional stakeholders, particularly the public sector. As a knowledge partner, the university filled gaps in information (know-what), skills (know-how) and networks (know-who). The last two aspects are potentially unique to the university’s role in place branding networks and require further development. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual framework demonstrates the potential of a single-player university in a peripheral region to enhance the capabilities and skills of stakeholders in place branding networks and widen stakeholder participation. Future researchers can use the framework to develop recommendations for universities’ role in place branding based on their unique situation. Originality/value: There has been limited research on how universities participate and influence participation in place branding. The exploration of this topic in the context of a rural, marginalised region is also novel. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Innovation in higher education management and leadership has experienced a continuous increase in demand, worldwide. The emergence of global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has accelerated the adoption and implementation of this innovation. Furthermore, technological advancement can be attributed to changes in educational management and leadership. The use of business models, theories, and methods such as the Education Management Information System (EMIS) has improved the collection, analysis, interpretation, storage, and retrieval of data to increase how they make well-informed decisions. Therefore, the strategies employed in higher education management and leadership have undergone many changes and updates. However, further research is required to ensure that best practices, evidence, and data-driven methods are used to improve staff/follower satisfaction and high performance of students and teachers in higher education institutions. This study explores the impact of innovation on management and leadership in higher education institutions. Findings from several countries show a strong positive correlation between increase in innovation and better educational management and leadership. Additionally, openness to change and happiness of stakeholders in higher education institutions increases when leaders and educational management are trained through conferences and benchmarking activities. Hence, using emerging technology and openness to change through education, awareness creation, and training, the level of innovation in universities and other higher education institutions increases, which in turn promotes performance and productivity.  © 2021 Siriphong Sauphayana.

Valuation discourses and disciplinary positioning struggles of academic researchers—A case study of ‘maverick’ academics
(2020) Palgrave Communications, 6 (1), art. no. 51, Cited 2 times.
DOI: 10.1057/s41599-020-0427-2

ABSTRACT: While it is known that researchers need to contend with increasing demands in the evolving landscape of higher education in the UK, few studies have examined how academic researchers discursively construct their struggles. This paper explores the valuation discourses that academic researchers draw upon to construct and account for their struggles in the process of establishing themselves as academics. It strives to answer the question: What kinds of struggles do academics face when positioning themselves and their research in relation to disciplines? What kinds of valuation discourses do academic researchers draw upon to position themselves as academics working in certain disciplines? The data comes from my PhD research, where I conducted 30 qualitative interviews with academic researchers ranging from PhD students, early career researchers to Professors Emeriti, who work in applied linguistics and language-related fields in UK universities. This paper focuses on two case studies of academics who positioned themselves as “mavericks” or who resist being pigeonholed in one discipline. In order to provide some comparative basis, the two case studies come from two ends of the academic career spectrum. I examine how they constructed their struggles with positioning themselves in relation to disciplines, and the kinds of valuation discourses evoked in the process. The paper proposes a model that conceptualizes how disciplinary positioning struggles are constructed by discursive acts and in the process, produce and reinforce valuation discourses about academic disciplines. Embedded in these disciplinary positioning struggles, researchers employed academic categories (Angermuller, 2017. High Educ 73(6):963–980) and evoked valuation discourses. The paper illustrates how academics hold valuation discourses about the kinds of disciplinary positioning practices that are valued, which may sometimes differ from the valuation discourses of fellow researchers, institutions and other stakeholders in higher education. The paper argues that such incongruence in valuation discourses between the individual and others result in positioning struggles. © 2020, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: At present a substantial insecurity prevails about the future of eLearning and particularly about the future impact of digitalization on the educational sector. Those, who have been enthusiastic at the beginning are now more esceptical about the future development of teaching with digital media, others maintain their positive attitude and look for ways to promote and implement their use in the university. Less discussed are the economic implications that digitization may have on the universities stakeholders and their decision making. In the field of online and distance education a descriptive approach of the costs and benefits has been so far predominant. We will raise instead some points to initiate a discussion about the economics of digital educational ressources and the possibile reaction and impact of teachers, students and institutions. We will point out also some long-term perspectives that digitalization of education might have on a global level. Concluding we will argue that digitilization of educational content and the respective applications followed a continuous development pushed especially by universities of distance education and that phenomena such as MOOCs are not as "disruptive" as some claim. Instead, national policies, economic sustainability and the impact of digitization on different stakeholders will determine the future form of the "Digital University" in case such a university exists. © 2018 Revista de Educacion a Distancia.

ABSTRACT: Introduction: the article deals with the problems arising in the Russian higher education system during its transformation. The topicality of this study lies in posing a problem of higher education development within the boundaries of a Russian macroregion. The objective of this article is to reveal barriers to the implementation of nonlinear processes in Russian higher education, which trigger the emergence of institutional traps and to determine the ways to avoid them. The purpose of this article is to identify barriers to the implementation of nonlinear processes in Russian higher education, which cause the emergence of institutional traps and determine the ways out of them. Materials and Methods: an institutional approach and the concept of non-linear models of higher education are the methodological basis of this research. The methods were developed by the research group of the Ural Federal University for sociological estimation of higher education transformation in the region. The procedure for selecting experts was realized according to the sociological methodology of I. E. Shteinberg (eight-window selection). Results: a summary analysis is made; inter-institutional interaction in terms of the "higher education - stakeholders" dyad is presented; the principal problematic areas are highlighted; and institutional traps preventing potential nonlinear development in Russian higher education are described. In the first problem zone, motivation traps, traps of formalisation/individualisation of the educational process, traps of intensification of the introduction of new information technologies in education and traps of unification of management were revealed. In the second problem area, traps of network interactions, traps of network interactions of higher education and employers, as well as traps of global/local orientation of universities were identified and analysed. Discussion and Conclusions: the authors outlined the most significant systemic ways for avoiding the described traps and present solutions for solving contradictions, which can be considered in terms of strategies and tactics for the management of reform processes in Russian universities. The proposed solutions are directly related to the activation of the main educational communities' potential. Within the framework of the project, the authors' method of sociological study of higher education transition to its nonlinear development within the boundaries of a particular macroregion was developed and tested. © 2018 National Research Ogarev Mordovia State University.

ABSTRACT: This case study reports the collaborative meaning-making process and strategies for organizational change used by a diverse leadership team at a regional comprehensive university. The purpose of the study was to engage in continuous learning and improvement by producing knowledge for informing action; that is, to learn from analyzing the first phase of implementation in order to continue to improve, understand, and perhaps adjust in order to contribute to institutional change. Initiated by outcomes from a 2017 regional accreditation review and the recent development of a Global Campus, administrators, faculty, and instructional design and technology staff were charged with developing standards for quality university distance education. This study addresses lived experiences in the story of institutional change by reporting critical events, tensions, and turning points experienced by the leadership team relative to a change framework applied to distance education in a higher education setting. Over a two-year period (2018–2020), the team piloted, communicated, and refined plans as they began implementing the first of four phases in their quality assurance plan, including assessing 751 course syllabi for entry-level design standards. Findings indicate the process of enacting change also began shifting the culture of the university for purposes of quality assurance, consistency, and shared understandings of rigor. In this article, the team describes and discusses their framework using Kotter’s Change Model, their process, and their outcomes related to organizational change in higher education. Discussion addresses starting points for other higher education stakeholders involved in pursuing quality distance education. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Can stakeholder organisations support and put pressure on organisational change at universities to implement sustainable development? In recent years, universities across the world have made progress in both promoting and implementing sustainable development (SD). However, despite the fact that the United Nations message that stakeholder participation is crucial for the implementation of sustainable development (in particular SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals), research on the role of higher education stakeholder networks in the context of organisational change towards sustainable development remains underdeveloped. First, the paper discusses state of the art literature on the role of stakeholder networks for the implementation of sustainable development in higher education. Secondly, using a systemic approach the paper explores some potential steps for addressing the practical and policy challenges required to support the implementation of sustainable development through the role of stakeholder networks. The paper then critiques the present and future prospects of such relationships. This paper will present a systemic perspective of how universities can be more attuned and adapt to continue the promotion of sustainable development goals amongst their community of influence. It will also be useful for practitioners and policy makers working to address sustainable development implementation challenges in higher education. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

ABSTRACT: Internationalization of higher education (IHE) has become one of the most prominent strategies in national policies and universities’ agendas during the past three decades. IHE provides numerous benefits to nations, institutions, and higher education stakeholders and plays a vital role in improving the quality of education and research. However, it is difficult to argue that all countries equally benefit from IHE; that is, power inequalities between countries in the world are reflected in universities’ efforts and outcomes regarding internationalization. To analyse the effects of national boundaries on IHE, this article presents qualitative research conducted in two European countries: Poland and Turkey. Thirty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted with international office professionals. The results revealed that IHE in Poland and Turkey, as examples of peripheral countries in terms of IHE, is restricted by political instability, economic impotency and socio-cultural legacies. These factors lead to a nation-bounded internationalization experience for higher education institutions and individual stakeholders in both countries. The results also revealed some differences between the two countries and it is argued that decentralized internationalization strategies designed based on nations’ unique characteristics are needed to drive the progressive values of IHE forward. © 2023 HERDSA.

ABSTRACT: With changed relationships between society, the market, and universities, stakeholders have penetrated China’s traditional monopolistic relationships between the state and public higher education institutions, with the role of external actors becoming far more important during the last few decades in influencing internal affairs of individual higher education institutions. As the proportion of governmental sources for higher education (in relation to GDP) shrinks year by year, the share of students and their families has been increasing significantly. Alongside China’s developmental paths/models there have been changes of university governance modes as well, which have led to changed relationships among stakeholders with different winners and losers created each time. This chapter focuses on the three most significant stakeholders in Chinese higher education: governments, students and their families, and the business community. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Public open spaces services have been shown to be profoundly affected by rapid urban-ization and environmental changes, and in turn, they have influenced socio-cultural relationships and human well-being. However, the impact of these changes on public open space services (POSS) remains unexplored, particularly in the Saudi Arabian context. This study examines the socio-cultural influence of POSS on the King Abdulaziz University campus, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and the impact of these services on well-being. A field survey and questionnaire were used to collect data. Non-parametric tests (Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests) were used to find significant differences in the importance of POSS as perceived by stakeholders based on socio-demographic attributes. Factor analysis was performed for 14 POSS to identify those that are most important. The study showed that (i) university stakeholders are closely linked to services provided by public open spaces (POS) and dependent on POSS, (ii) there were significant differences in the perceived importance of POSS according to gender, age, and social groups, and (iii) 70 to 90% of stakeholders reported POSS as having a positive impact on well-being. Thus, the findings will help design and plan POSS to meet the needs of society and promote well-being. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Evaluation of work-integrated learning: A realist synthesis and toolkit to enhance university evaluative practices
(2021) International Journal of Work-Integrated Learning, 22 (3), pp. 213 - 239, Cited 4 times.
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116000236&partnerID=40&md5=a7cf3866254bda62b689a044cb79694c

ABSTRACT: Situated in the context of work-integrated learning (WIL), this paper aims to build the evaluative capacity of universities in response to an increasing need for evaluation in higher education. It contributes a realist synthesis of international peer-reviewed literature on university evaluation of WIL, which revealed no use of evaluation theory or approaches by the authors. In response, to support the enhancement of university evaluative practices, this paper offers a toolkit of evaluation theory and approaches, with examples relating to WIL, featuring an evaluation planning tool (RUFDATAE). RUFDATAE is demonstrated using a study from the realist synthesis, to highlight its relevance, usefulness and simplicity, or ease of use, for university stakeholders conducting any evaluation. This paper also contributes to recent scholarly debates about evaluation – how it is perceived and differs from research – suggesting evaluation could be considered as an extension of research. © 2021 International Journal of Work-Integrated Learning.

ABSTRACT: Our paper focuses on digitalisation and sustainable higher education using the analysis of the institutions of professional academic dynasties and assessing their constructive and destructive potential for the sustainable development of universities and higher education institutions (HEI). In this paper, the development and functioning of professional dynasties are viewed from both sides constructively and destructively in relation to the processes and organisational mechanisms in the academic sphere. We find that destructive tendencies are often associated with nepotism and clannishness which makes it possible to restrict access to resources and career growth, as well as to extract institutional rent associated with the administrative weight. Furthermore, it also appears that constructive trends in the development of academic dynasties are associated with the concepts of continuity, reputation, and increase in research and scientific output that can be measured using advanced information and communication tools. Moreover, the paper also contemplates the impact of recent innovations and changes in academia and HEI brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. We assess those changes and their potential for the further digitalisation of higher education that would lead to conserving energy, promoting a sustainable way of living and environmental education. Our results confirm that the digitalisation of higher education would lead to its sustainable development and optimal energy usage. Further decisive steps need to be made by the policy-makers and stakeholders in higher education for continuing the current trends and taking them to another level. Shaping up views and opinions on the sustainable future can and should be effectively delivered through educational processes. © Vilnius University.

ABSTRACT: Futures studies are not new to the Malaysian Higher Education scenario. Numerous research articles have been written documenting details of futures interventions ranging from intensive silo university-based programmes to the centralized ministry-based ones. Universities such as Universiti Sains Malaysia and Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka manifested the relevance of futures-oriented thinking and planning among its stakeholders, which led to intensive futures workshop held in the early years of 2002 and 2012 respectively. The Ministry of Higher Education through its Higher Education Leadership Academy or AKEPT had also initiated structured futures programmes in the years of 2012-2014 for higher education stakeholders consisted of vice-chancellors, deputy vice-chancellors, university professors and academics. Although many studies have been shared with reference to the futures studies efforts by Malaysian universities and the ministry, but a comprehensive meta-analysis has not been made available yet. This study is a meta-analysis based on futures scenarios articles produced by experts and practitioners of foresight studies. It provides a run-through of the foresight endeavours with reference to the Malaysian Higher Education specifying details on the conceptual framework adopted, methods, results and discussions with a strong indication of the unequivocal importance of futures studies in canvassing a dynamic image of the preferred future; subsequently triggering deeper futures thinking and innovation- oriented higher education community. © 2018 Journal of Futures Studies.

ABSTRACT: University branding has become a significant issue in higher education field. Generally, university stakeholders play a very important role for university branding by co-creating value each other. Service Dominant Logic (SDL) seems to be a good approach for discussing value co-creation among university stakeholders. This research aims to propose a new model for university branding management through the lens of experience value co-creation with university stakeholders. Two cases of laboratories in universities are analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model through analyzing experience value co-creation process by students and professors. Experience value co-creation enhances the laboratories brand and this leads to enhance the universities brand. © 2012 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Constructivism is increasingly being included into higher education curriculum design. The goal is simple: to enhance the learning experiences, the learned outcomes, and the graduate capabilities of students. However, the inclusion or addition of constructivist learning models and methods into curricula can occur in a non-holistic, inefficient or piecemeal manner. There exists an increasing demand from stakeholders in higher education course curricula that they produce graduates with a greater level of authenticity in their competency and capability and to be better able to cope with change, complexity and uncertainty as professional practitioners. Can a more effective learning and development environment where active learning is observable and assessable be created using a blend of constructivist learning and instructivist/objectivist learning philosophies, models, methods, and techniques? Can the authenticity and practice proximity be quantitatively assessed for such a learning and development environment in order to better enable the design, implementation, and ongoing dynamic optimisation of more authentic course curricula? To research this, a learning and development environment inclusive of constructivist experiential learning methods and traditional instructivist/objectivist learning methods was trialled in 2016 within a core undergraduate project management unit. Observations and results from the initial trial indicate that the proposed learning and development environment model can be successfully implemented and achieve improved learning outcomes. A conceptual quantitative method seeking to determine the relative combined proportion of task authenticity and practice proximity was also developed. © 2017 Engineers Australia.

ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has hindered the effectiveness of museum management and curatorship, a growing concern for the movement of international heritage conservation. Accordingly, this participatory action research explores the emergence of the Museum of World Languages at Shanghai International Studies University during the COVID-19 pandemic. By drawing insights from Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of symbolic power and social agency in the new museology, this paper explores the educative, social, and political roles of the new language museum and the experiences of student curators with the new language museum. This paper promotes scholarly conversations about the curatorial narration of the language halls, the new coordinator’s responsibility, curatorial philosophy, experiential learning, social responsibility, political savvy, and intercultural communication and digital literacy competencies among the student curators. This study enhances the theoretical rigor and provides practical action agendas for diverse stakeholders in higher education administration and museum management beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: This article introduces the special issue of Tertiary Education and Management dedicated to the positions and roles of students in higher education governance. Students are today recognized as being the "major stakeholder" in higher education, but their actual participation in governance has largely failed to attract the attention of scholars. The aim of this special issue is therefore to address this omission by providing research-based portraits of students' involvement in higher education governance in five European countries. In this introduction, we present our conceptual framework by outlining four models of higher education governance and introduce the five articles on the selected countries that constitute the core of this special issue. © 2011 European Higher Education Society.

ABSTRACT: This article studies the salience of internal university stakeholders in collaborative degree programmes from the perspective of the sustainability of such programmes. In terms of academics and administrators involved in Finnish-Russian collaborative degrees, the article explores what contributes to their salience, and their effects on the implementation of internationalisation policies at individual, partnership and programme levels. In order to deepen understanding of collaborative degree sustainability as a particular case of internationalisation activity, the article addresses the attributes of the stakeholders’ salience as revealed during their interplay in Finnish-Russian double degree partnerships. Based on this analysis, the article highlights why the stakeholders in Finnish and Russian universities attribute their respective salience differently, identifies these differences, and assesses their impact on double degree sustainability. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Showing and discussing examples of how people achieve goals can become a great source of inspiration (Piirto, 2011). Young people, especially students of different socio-cultural backgrounds, should be initiated and engaged in authentic projects and ideas. This article gives concrete reasons to K-12 and higher education stakeholders of why and how such projects should become part of curricula. This case study presents the creation of a multicultural disc in three languages (Greek, Corsican, and French) as an attempt to add to the inspirational development of students to aid teachers to achieve overall educational aims. © Kaplan Singapore.

ABSTRACT: eCompetence combines the motivation and capability of faculty members to use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). This paper develops a theoretical framework for the concept of eCompetence of academic staff, and it explores principles for the design of respective faculty development measures. A literature review identifies key components and assembles them into a model of action competence which serves as the basis for developing an approach to eCompetence. The concept of eCompetence is specified by contextual factors that teachers face in eLearning scenarios. The paper finally discusses portfolio models to increase the motivation of faculty to use learning technologies for their courses. The main managerial implication of this paper for involved higher education stakeholders is that universities have to create holistic portfolios for faculty development which considerably extend both the scope and the breadth of traditional training measures.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore parents as “stakeholders” in higher education in England and how they perceive teaching excellence. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a qualitative research design using an interpretative approach through which the authors aimed to develop understandings of parents’ perspectives as higher education “stakeholders”. The empirical data were gathered via focus group interviews and an online survey with 24 participants in the UK. Findings: This study found that the majority of parents wished to be treated as an important stakeholder group in higher education. Parent participants perceived that teaching excellence could be evidenced through indicators and measures, for example, the design and delivery of the courses, progress measures, contact hours, speed of return of marked work, graduate employability and so on. They also saw value and significance in the students’ exposure to ideas and perspectives not previously experienced, in zeal and passion in the teaching, and in an academically nurturing, understanding and supportive pedagogical relationship between academic and student. Originality/value: This study uncovered some apparent tensions, contradictions and challenges for parents as stakeholders in higher education, for example, in reconciling the co-existence of their desire to be involved and engaged with scope for students to be formed as independent young adults. Parents’ desire to measure teaching excellence is also compounded by their concern that excellent teaching is thereby reduced to a box-ticking exercise. This study has implications for higher education institutions wishing to engage parents as a stakeholder group in a meaningful way. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: It has always been a challenge to improve student learning outcomes. Stakeholders in higher education institutions need to go beyond traditional methods and develop new practices to elevate student’s performance in mathematics. This research assessed the influencers of student Mathematics performance and also determined the issues and concerns encountered by the students in learning Mathematics. The descriptive-correlational method was employed using a survey questionnaire. There were 370 respondents in the sample and it was selected using simple random sampling from the population of the students at Cebu Technological University North Cell Campus. The data were statistically analyzed through percentage, frequency counts, weighted mean, ranking and Chi – square test for significant difference. The results revealed that home/family, school environment, classmates/peers, community, media and emerging technology were not significantly affecting the performance of the students in Mathematics. However, attending Mathematics classes as a perquisite of their courses was the main problem encountered by the respondents of this study. Based on these data analysis, the researchers proposed human and material resource development plan for enhancing students’ performance in Mathematics. Moreover, the researchers recommend future research to dig deeper into the factors inside and outside school premises to identify influencers that influence students’ academic performance especially in Mathematics. © 2020, Conscientia Beam.

Intellectual capital: A valuable resource for university technology commercialisation?
(2013) Proceedings of the European Conference on Knowledge Management, ECKM, 1, pp. 429 - 437, Cited 2 times.
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893548680&partnerID=40&md5=6d773f60fed93d3ac9b3636320824280

ABSTRACT: With the emergence of the knowledge-based economy, intellectual capital (IC) has gained prominence in literature. In a knowledge-based society, knowledge is recognised as the driver of productivity and growth (OECD, 2011) thus this intangible asset is regarded as the hidden value of an organisation. Parallel to this development, universities role in society has changed whereby they are expected to contribute directly to economic development through technology transfer. University technology transfer (referred to from here onwards as UTT) is an uncertain and risky process whereby multiple stakeholders interact to commercialise knowledge residing within universities. Thus, it is a knowledge intensive process where competitive advantage is often based on intangible assets, namely lC. IC and knowledge management are closely intertwined with both concepts being linked to superior innovation performance. However, very little research has looked at this vital intangible side related to knowledge transfer and exchange within UTT (Lockett et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2011). This paper attempts to help fill this gap by exploring IC within a UTT context, with the aim of unravelling its importance for knowledge transfer and sharing. A qualitative methodology of one university was undertaken to explore this under-researched area. Various factors attributed to IC were found to both enhance and hinder knowledge sharing during university technology commercialisation processes. These factors are broken up into human capital factors which comprised of networking capability, learning orientation and attitudes; relational capital factors which comprised of relationship building, trust and synergy and structural capital factors which comprised of procedures and social integration mechanisms. This research found that the three key components of IC play a key role in affecting knowledge transfer and sharing and consequently impact UTT activities. Research on IC is still in its infancy and more empirical studies are needed to explore the managerial issues related to IC (Dumay and Garanina, 2013); thus this research will give UTT practitioners and University stakeholders an insight of the importance of valuing and managing their intangible assets to aid the entrepreneurial mission of universities.

ABSTRACT: Free-roaming campus dogs and cats are common in Mexico and other countries. There is generally no policy regarding their status and management. Thus, the wellbeing and tolerance or acceptance of campus dogs and cats relies on university stakeholders, who may have different perceptions regarding these animals. The objective of this study was to investigate university stakeholder perceptions of campus dogs and cats and self-reported human–animal interactions in Yucatán, Mexico, as a first step to understanding human–animal relations in a campus setting. A survey was conducted at four campuses (including one high school) of the Autonomous University of Yucatán. Students, faculty members, administrative staff, and janitors were invited to participate, and 353 questionnaires were completed and analyzed (181 women, 160 men, ages ranging from 15 to 67 years). Students were more likely to “absolutely like” the presence of campus dogs, and cats. There was general agreement among stakeholders that “the ideal situation for a cat is to roam free,” but they did not think the same about dogs. Human–animal interactions included feeding and/or touching campus dogs and cats. Logistic regression models showed that cat owners were more likely to feed campus cats, whereas dog owners were more likely to feed and touch campus dogs. Students were more likely to touch campus dogs and cats. Those who disliked or were indifferent to campus dogs and cats were unlikely to feed or touch them. Most respondents perceived problems with campus dogs (85%) and cats (68%), with differences among stakeholders and campuses. The most commonly perceived problem for dogs and cats was poor animal welfare (i.e., too thin and/or sick). Faculty members were the most concerned about dogs and cats projecting a bad image of the university. Management initiatives should target those who feed and touch dogs and cats and also address the concerns of faculty members, administrative staff, and janitors. Active engagement of university stakeholders may alleviate perceived problems and improve on-campus animal welfare. © 2021 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).

ABSTRACT: This paper focuses on a community–university partnership built around a programme of study co-created by residents of a disadvantaged community and situated, for the most part, within that community. The aim of this paper is to share lessons learned from this community engagement initiative, as identified through a research study which ran concurrent to the programme. The study involved 41 interviews (18 individual interviews and 23 focus groups) over a two-year period with 28 participants. Participants included students, lecturers and community and university stakeholders. The finding section focuses on the characteristics of the initiative which allowed it to positively impact those involved. The data indicated that (i) the authenticity of the partnership between the community and university, (ii) the suitability of the lecturers and (iii) the ability of the lecturers and management to adapt the programme to identified needs were all key to the success of the programme. The paper concludes with a discussion, incorporating relevant literature, regarding what can be learned from this programme for those interested in enacting truly engaged practice in Irish higher education. © 2018 Educational Studies Association of Ireland.

ABSTRACT: An increasing interest in examining the Health and Physical Education Program (HPEP) has become evident to higher education institutions. However, the studies on the satisfaction of university stakeholders from the said program remain scarce. This study, therefore, examines the perceived satisfaction of university stakeholders from HPEP, including its distinct aspects/ areas and program offerings in an international higher education institution. Validated instruments such as a survey that received an overall mean score of 4.85 (SD=0.34) and an interview protocol with a mean score of 4.89 (SD=0.23) obtained data from university graduates/ alumni (n=250) and faculty members (n=10) between 2010 and 2018. The survey data indicated that alumni respondents evaluated the HPEP educational services (4.12 [SD=0.96]), learning environment (4.26 [SD=0.88]), and facilities (4.19 [SD=0.92]) with a high level of satisfaction. The adequacy of skills learned (3.80 [SD=1.16]), adequacy of HPEP as a program (4.08 [SD=0.08]), and relevance of the HPEP (4.11 [SD=0.07]) received a high-level satisfaction. On the other hand, the interview data revealed faculty members’ satisfaction with some recommendations for improving the general aspects of the HPEP. While both alumni and faculty members were satisfied based on their understanding and experience of HPEP, discipline-centric activities, and infrastructure, there remains a need for consistency in the services offered, maintenance of facilities and equipment, and demand for strengthening values and transferable skills developed by HPEP. This study is of relevance to health and physical education scholars and practitioners. It may likewise serve as a lens to revisit the HPEP for program improvement. © 2022 by authors,.

ABSTRACT: Tom (pseudonym) was an international undergraduate student with a rare visual disability, known as cone dystrophy. His appearance was that of a normal person but variations in light greatly influenced his vision. During his first two years at a university in Australia, Tom had particular difficulty making sense of assessment and feedback. His perceptions, struggles and strategies are presented here as a narrative, primarily in his own words. Tom’s interactions with academics were strong contributors to his mostly negative perceptions about assessment and feedback. Key influencers were his cultural background, his approach to feedback, and his own expectations of the role feedback should play. An analysis of four in-depth interviews and a written response of this student’s attitudes, needs and issues demonstrate how academics, university stakeholders and experts in assessment and feedback can develop a raised awareness of, and sensitivity to, specialised ways of assisting international students with disabilities. A greater exploration and unpacking of these students’ individual needs and difficulties is suggested in the process of understanding feedback and assessment in a new academic context. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Digital transformation has been inevitable in all socio-economic fields, including higher education. Recently, under the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities have to change their entire teaching systems to online learning to ensure their students' learning is not interrupted. Thus, it is essential to study how universities’ students, educators, and administrators perceive online learning in different countries. To this aim, this study investigates the factors affecting university members' preference for online learning in Singapore and Vietnam. Using a cross-country sample with a sound theoretical framework of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we found that each member group in the university was influenced by a different weight of factors. Specifically, students' preference for online learning is most affected by their technical skills. Meanwhile, educators and administrators are influenced mainly by the perceived usefulness of online learning and practice conditions, respectively. We further conducted multi-group testing and confirmed the certain separation in online learning preferences of observed objects between the two countries. Overall, this paper enriches the literature on online education, and has important implications for educational policymakers and university stakeholders both during and after the pandemic. © The Author(s) 2022.

ABSTRACT: This research tries to highlight on how knowledge management (KM) will act as a good tool to connect all the university’s Stakeholders such as: Students, teachers, researchers, business and external entities, with work processes and technologies. Today, the quality of higher education in developing countries has become more complex as they have to keep pace and compete with the international higher educational institutions (HEIs) standards. The purpose of this research is to provide empirical evidence that increases an understanding of KM practices in HEIs within the context of instable environments, focusing on the unique geopolitical situation of the occupied Palestine. A primary focus of this paper is to investigate the social phenomenon without explicit expectations or early assumptions, asking a deep qualitative questions of “why” people of Palestine look for knowledge, “how” they use this knowledge, and “how” they face the instability of the complicated situation in order to develop a knowledge society. © 2016, Econjournals.

ABSTRACT: Two major initiatives aimed at enhancing University-Stakeholder Engagement (U-SE) are addressed here. First, we discuss an innovative Knowledge Transfer Programme (KTP) introduced by the Ministry of Education in Malaysia in 2011 for which Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) serves as the Secretariat. Since the beginning, KTP has committed approximately USD20 million to the programme split between industry 70 % and community 30 %, with a caveat of 30 % or more input from the partners. Since its inception, 349 projects (industry 219 and community 130) have been implemented throughout Malaysia, with the participation of more than 1400 academic staff, 650 graduate interns, and 3500 employees from Industry and Community. Secondly, we highlight the role of four international/regional Networks USM supports as Secretariat. In this context we wish to provide our experience and best practices involving, APUCEN (Asia-Pacific University Community Engagement Network), SEASN (South-East Asia Sustainability Network), ALKN (ASEAN Local Knowledge Network) and RSEN (Regional Sejahtera ESD Network). This paper will, thus, cover one major knowledge transfer programme partnership involving ‘university-industry/community’, and four specific ‘network’ initiatives designed to promote university-stakeholder engagement at a variety of levels. The range of knowledge transferred, approaches used, and the support provided by the university will hopefully provide replicable ideas to other aspiring higher educational institutions as they position themselves to be more proactively engaged. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

ABSTRACT: U.S. states are increasingly using multi-stakeholder groups to advise on marine aquaculture policy and research development. Such groups typically include some mix of government (e.g., tribal, federal, state, or local) and non-governmental (e.g., private, non-profit, or university) stakeholders. The engagement of such multi-stakeholder groups in the marine aquaculture policy process allows governments to harness the expertise of vested policy stakeholders and ensure that policy solutions are contextually appropriate. Taking stock of the participants in these groups is an important first step in understanding the broader role they play in the aquaculture policy process. In this article, a stakeholder analysis of ten multi-stakeholder groups engaged in aquaculture policy development, referred to as aquaculture partnerships, is conducted based on conceptual guidance from the Advocacy Coalition Framework. In the context of these 10 partnerships, partnerships' participant compositions as well as inter-sectoral differences relating to (i) aquaculture policy beliefs; (ii) problem perceptions; (iii) resources; (iv) trust perceptions; (v) coordination patterns; and (vi) factors based upon which individuals coordinate with others in their partnerships are identified. Results from the stakeholder analysis show that partnerships have substantial representation from government and non-government policy stakeholders, that leveraging expertise through the collaborative policymaking process is critical, and that even within these multi-stakeholder groups, government actors maintain a critical position. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Articles in this two-issue series have done an excellent job showing how higher education stakeholders responded to a rapidly changing postsecondary context due to COVID-19. In this concluding essay, I reflect on some of that work and take a moment to also focus on what has not changed. As many others have noted, the pandemic amplified already-existing aspects of societal inequality. This was due in part to decisions, policies, and institutional practices grounded in unchanging logics that accept, maintain, or exacerbate inequitable systems and processes. As more people recognize the injustices in our postsecondary system that COVID-19 has helped to reveal, the time is right for a new progressive research agenda. Building on the work authors have contributed to these issues, the agenda must include new ways of thinking and investigating questions that often remain unasked. It must come from a place of seeing a possible transformation for higher education. As part of this agenda, racism, ableism, neoliberalism, and related ideologies must be analyzed, scrutinized, and ultimately transformed if higher education is to address the continuation of the COVID-19 crisis and be ready for the next ones. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the strategic role played by the University Management Teams (hereafter, UMTs) as a key internal stakeholder for the successful performance and sustainability of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Regarding the UMTs, we focus on four main dimensions: profile (background and professional experience), response to a dilemmatic situation, training needs (technical and managerial skills) and strategic management orientation. By using MAXQDA (v.10) data analysis software, we apply a qualitative methodological approach, based on in-depth semi-structured and reflexive interviews with a sample of UMTs belonging to a young small-sized Spanish university, characterized by its trajectory and involvement in strategic management. We found some consensus regarding the main drivers of the UMTs managerial performance, where the seniority in the academic position, institutional engagement, previous training on management (mentorship), professionalization and strategic thought are crucial to ensuring a more flexible, adaptive, competitive and sustainable HEI in the long term. © 2022, Centre of Sociological Research.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore trust initiation and development in collaborations between universities and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the implications for enabling engaged scholarship (ES). Design/methodology/approach: Adopting a qualitative inductive approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive maximum variation sample comprising 14 SMEs and 12 university stakeholders. Findings: The authors highlight the role of calculus-based trust in the initiation of collaborations emphasising the key roles of networking and referrals. As collaborations develop, reciprocal insights regarding stakeholders’ competencies and integrity and the development of knowledge-based trust can support engagement, in particular, knowledge application. Although relationships have a common sense of purpose, a fully engaged campus remains absent. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on a collaborative research between eight SMEs and one university business school and does not reflect ES fully as conceptualised. It provides few insights into the role of trust (or distrust) in such collaborations where things go wrong. Practical implications: Universities looking to enable ES collaborations with SMEs need to develop and enact strategies which support ongoing engagement and enable identification-based trust (IBT). Recommendations for universities and human resource development regarding interventions to support trust initiation and development to enable knowledge application ES are outlined and suggestions are offered for future research. Social implications: University strategies to support the development of trust and, in particular, IBT are likely to benefit longer-term relationships and the development of ES between SMEs and universities. Originality/value: Little research has been undertaken on trust initiation and development between academic and SME stakeholders or the associated implications for ES. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Higher education institutions should take into account the needs of stakeholders in the planning and development of quality educational services. In general, the stakeholders are divided into two categories: internal and external stakeholders. This study aims to explore the diverse basic needs of the university internal stakeholders (students, academic staff, and employees) and the impact of the services on the brand image of the educational institutions. Consensus has been built that an organization's image can only be or assessed by its stakeholders or constituents. Utilizing the qualitative approach through empirical semi-structured interviews, data were collected from both Benghazi University in the country of Libya and Yarmouk University in the country of Jordan. To gain an in-depth understating of the basic services, interviews were conducted with 41 university internal stakeholders (students, academic staff, and employees). The findings have a remarkable impact on the education services quality and the perception of brand image of both institutions, which subsequently affects the Libyan and Jordanian economy. The paper explores the differences between the needs of the three groups. This study is of value to educational leaders as it serves as contribution to the well designing of comprehensive plans of the university, by providing the decision makers with information on the needs of the university internal stakeholders. Managements can develop policies, which will improve the safety of customers and staff and increase collaborations with both universities stakeholders, etc. Accordingly, the results provide a foundation on which future research can be built. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Teaching excellence is a multidimensional and highly contested concept among stakeholders in higher education (HE) environments. Thus, there is no universally accepted definition of, nor consensus of opinion on what constitutes, teaching excellence in HE environments. Moreover, there exists a paucity of empirical research on teaching excellence in the context of tertiary level business and management education particularly from the perspective of senior level academics. Accordingly, this study explores notions of what constitutes teaching excellence in the context of business and management education based on semi-structured interviews with 10 senior level academics in Australian, British and Canadian university business and management schools. The paper presents practitioner attributes, research activeness, the involvement of key stakeholders, the learning environment, students as active partners, the learning journey and the informed curricula as 7 perspectives on teaching excellence relating to business and management education that are shaped by how senior management (leadership) teams interpret, articulate, promote, lead, support, monitor and review a shared notion or framework of teaching excellence within business and management schools, and the faculty subculture and wider institutional culture within which they operate. The implications of the study provide credible and meaningful suggestions for promoting teaching excellence in the provision of tertiary level business and management education based on the 7 perspectives of teaching excellence presented in the paper. The research contributes to, and furthers, our understanding of teaching excellence in HE pertaining to business and management education. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Higher education interest groups remain somewhat understudied from a comparative theory-driven perspective. This is surprising because political decisions regarding higher education must increasingly be legitimized to students, taxpayers, the academic community and society. This article aims to advance our understanding of higher education stakeholders in post-communist Europe. In our view, the region deserves more attention, not least because students and academics were very instrumental in bringing down communism and institutionalizing democracy. First, we draw on Klemenčič’s (EJHE 2(1): 2–19, 2012; SHE 39(3):396–411, 2014) distinction between corporatist and pluralist as well as formalized and informal systems of representation in higher education. Looking at survey data from four countries—Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia—we examine to what extent post-communist democracies have established corporatist institutions to facilitate the formal participation of various crucial stakeholder organizations, e.g. students’ unions, academic unions, rectors’ conferences, etc. Then we address whether higher education organizations enjoy privileged access to policy-makers compared to those from other policy areas, while engaging with the argument that higher education is a particular case of “stakeholder democracy” in a region otherwise characterized by weak civic participation and corporatism. To wrap up, we discuss different “mutations of higher education corporatism” in each country. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant influence on all aspects of society, and it is necessary to comprehend the responses of various stakeholders as well as the challenges that higher education has encountered in the aftermath of the outbreak. This study systematically analyses the measures taken by higher education stakeholders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges faced by higher education in the post-COVID-19 era. To analyse the actions taken by higher education stakeholders and the challenges that remain, this study critically analyses government policy documents, reports from international organisations and perspectives of experts in the field of higher education, studies from Chinese journals, and international scientific literature. While stakeholders responded quickly during the outbreak, providing financial and material assistance, developing online learning, and facilitating international student mobility, the study finds that these measures are insufficient when compared to those in other sectors, and higher education stakeholders’ responses to COVID-19 have been fragmented, uncoordinated, and fraught with conflict and ambivalence. The study finds that higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic faces multiple challenges, with COVID-19 exacerbating inequities in educational access and educational achievement due to uneven educational infrastructure and resource allocation. The availability of infrastructure and the lack of preparedness of faculty and students have dimmed large-scale experiments in online education. Future international student mobility patterns may need to be restructured. © The Author(s) 2022.

ABSTRACT: Through an exploratory comparative case study of two U.S. states (Georgia and Nevada), this study investigates how the selection mechanism to state higher education governing agency boards influences the responsiveness of board members to stakeholders and their role in the policy-making process. Framed around the recent national policy agenda to improve postsecondary degree attainment and college completion, findings suggest that state agency board members in both states prioritized the opinions, insights, and goals of the state governor and governing agency staff, regardless of selection mechanism. However, for more localized issues and on-the-ground decision-making, stakeholders formally involved in the day-to-day operation of higher education, such as administrators, faculty, and students, serve a larger role, though this influence can be mediated by the selection mechanism of board members. © 2021, Arizona State University.

ABSTRACT: The 2015 Black student revolt at the University of Missouri (UM) Columbus will not be easily forgotten. The revolt, which led to the expulsion of both UM System President and Columbus campus Chancellor, is an example of what happens when a community of Black graduate, undergraduate, and student athletes become one. In this article the authors present a case study of the racial incidents, leading to the submission of demands, protests, hunger strike of Black students, and refusal to play by the football team. Utilizing interest convergence, the convergence interests among various university stakeholders is discussed. Specifically, the authors highlight how the interest among Blacks students and student athletes led to the divergence of interests between UM and White administrators. © The Journal of Negro Education.

ABSTRACT: Namibian higher education institutions (HEIs) have been striving to enhance quality assurance in the last decade. Building internal quality assurance (QA) capacity has been challenging. We explored the perceptions and experiences of internal QA stakeholders. This research is embedded in Margret Archer's social realism theory as a guide to improving internal QA systems. We adopted a case study design based on an interpretive paradigm. Two purposively selected HEIs with university status were selected, and we recruited participants from the universities' population of stakeholders based on their roles. We conducted semi-structured interviews with stakeholders. The findings showed that although both institutions had QA units, the institutions were still facing challenges to attaining effective quality implementation and administration. Challenges to implementing QA include slow implementation of programme changes, mentorship programmes having an overemphasis on early career academics and causing potential mistrust, a lack of financial resources and students' engagement in QA activities. © 2023 International Conference on Higher Education Advances.

Enhancing academic achievement in an introductory computer programming course through the implementation of guided inquiry-based learning and teaching
(2018) Asia-Pacific Forum on Science Learning and Teaching, 19 (2), art. no. 16, Cited 1 times.

ABSTRACT: Research reports using global data show that the failure rates in introductory programming courses average about 32%. As learners from schools join the university and enrol for different courses, they find the sudden transformation quite challenging. This makes it more challenging for first year university students, especially in difficult courses such as Introduction to Programming. As trends change with advances in technology, the traditional ways of presenting information during teaching and learning interface may not address students' needs. Lecturers and university stakeholders however, do make efforts to address these challenges by proposing innovative teaching methods. One of the common approaches that has been used profitably in certain science and engineering programmes is Guided Inquiry Learning (GIL). It is a form of inductive collaborative learning approach; where students are challenged to accomplish the desired learning outcomes in the course. This research applied GIL to the year-long Development Software 1 (DEV1120) course, which deals with basic programming principles that apply to all computer programming languages. The purpose was to observe whether or not there were more gains through a GIL approach in students' academic achievement than through traditional teaching. The research was located in the pragmatic paradigm using action research design and a mixed method approach. The population consisted of all the 49 first-year students enrolled for the course at a South African university. The students who volunteered to be included in the experimental group were taught using the GIL strategies while the other group were taught using traditional method. Both groups were assessed using the same assessment tools simultaneously. Results from these assessments, together with focus-group interviews, provided the core data for this study. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were carried out on the data: statistical analysis for the former (chi-square and t-test) and thematic analysis for the latter. Results indicated significant gains in academic achievements for the experimental group over those in the control group. © 2018, The Education University of Hong Kong. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The parents of university students are one of the major stakeholders in Higher Education, yet there appears to be little investigation of their views. A postal questionnaire was distributed to a sample of some 640 parents or parent substitutes having at least one child currently taking a first degree at a British university. 335 completed questionnaires were returned. These give a very consistent and homogeneous picture, with no important variations related to university, subject studied, or level of parents’ education, and almost none related to sex of parent. In general, parents take a clearly traditional view of Higher Education, with research as the most important activity of universities followed by teaching students. The latter should gain personal maturity and a useful qualification from their studies. There is a very strong preference for students to live away from home. These views are highly consistent with those of students themselves, both at university and before; but less so with trends in Higher Education seen by many experts. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of the study is to substantiate a fuzzy logic model for the usability of websites of higher education institutions in the context of digitalization of educational services based on the previous results of the stakeholder survey in accordance with the selected criteria: loading speed, convenience, efficiency, relevance, accessibility, interactivity, cross-browser compatibility, lack of forced content, attractive design, satisfaction. The research methodology is based on the results of the previous scoring of personal data and fuzzy logical conclusions of stakeholders regarding the convenience of using the websites of higher education institutions. As a result, a model of fuzzy logical inference was substantiated and implemented in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox MatLab environment according to the Mamdani algorithm based on 180 constructed rules. As a result of a study of eight institutions of higher education, the degree of usability of their sites was determined and a quantitative assessment of usability was obtained. The scope of application of the modeling results concerns the possibilities of providing a more accurate understanding of the directions for making further management decisions regarding improving the usability of the site in order to provide quality educational services within the boundaries of the existing online interaction of higher education institutions and their stakeholders. In practice, the use of the developed model is an effective tool for ensuring the quality of educational services in the context of active digitalization of the functioning of higher education institutions. © 2021, Vadym Hetman Kyiv National University of Economics.

ABSTRACT: Despite the increased awareness of climate change, many individuals remain indifferent without undertaking action for climate adaptation and mitigation. This suggests that the beliefs and concerns of global warming are multifaceted. Hence, more research is needed to understand people's beliefs and concerns to improve current climate change initiatives in sustainable universities. In an exploratory study, engineering university students at a large public university in Northwestern Mexico answered questions regarding their perceptions of climate change. Participants were recruited via convenience/snowball techniques, which provided access to a diverse sample. The whole population was (N = 200) divided into three different subgroups: information systems engineering, industrial and systems engineering, and mechatronics engineering. The research was carried out through the “Global Warming’s Six Americas” survey questionnaire created by and belonging to the Yale Project for Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. Findings show that a higher percentage of Mexican students believe not only that global warming is happening, but also, they are more extremely sure of that than Latinos in the USA. A series of correspondence analyses also allowed us to visualize a broader perspective of the global warming convictions among Mexican students. Authors also argue that higher education students worldwide will undoubtedly have a valuable role to play in the efforts to meet the 1.5 Paris Agreement Goal. In this context, sustainable university stakeholders need to prepare and enable them to build a system thinking to meet complex challenges posed by climate change. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

ABSTRACT: This article presents critical intercultural dialogue as a necessary curricular, pedagogical, and decolonial practice to engage and value Indigenous students’ cultural semiotic resources in higher education. Drawing from social semiotics, critical interculturality, and decolonial theory, the article analyzes Indigenous students’ structural barriers to accessing and completing their undergraduate programs. Using examples from pedagogy courses taught in English and reflections and learnings from a research project with Indigenous students, the article underscores and extends lessons to mobilize Indigenous students’ learning paths, sociocultural practices, and languages, showcasing intercultural dialogue within a public university. Reflections on the tensions, constraints, and possibilities to facilitate university stakeholders’ engagement at multiple levels are discussed. © 2023, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

ABSTRACT: Transnational routes such as direct-entry have become a more attractive option for Chinese students, due to the pandemic-imposed travel restrictions in China. The rise of Chinese direct-entry students can potentially lead to a significant increase in demand for academic and non-academic support not only after their arrival, but also before their departure from China. By applying Schlossberg’s transition theory, this paper seeks to develop a good understanding of the academic and social belonging of Chinese direct-entry students in the UK through re-analysing the portraits (written narratives) of a previous research project. The findings indicate that these students were feeling disconnected from the academic and social communities. The factors affecting their sense of belonging are described using the 4S framework, namely self, strategies, situation and support. The paper ends with recommendations to key university stakeholders on how the partner institutions in China and the UK can help enhance a sense of academic and social belongingness of Chinese direct-entry students. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This study focuses on how to tokenize educational assets and discusses how tokenization and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be operationalized and adopted to the higher education landscape to provide funds for students during their higher education studies. To that end, it builds upon the income-contingent loans and higher education funding literature to propose a system that captures the value of the student’s potential future income streams as a token to be offered to higher education stakeholders willing to invest in a young person’s future, make an impact toward the Sustainable Development Goals, or simply, to diversify their portfolios and hedge against market downturns. The Future Income Token “FIT” is conceptually devised through a literature review and builds on previous findings by the author. This interdisciplinary study fits into the blockchain, crowdfunding, and higher education finance literature. Given the increasing difficulty of mobilizing funds for higher education and, the almost universal, growing student loan default problem, it asks the question: What aspects of higher education tokenomics may give higher education stakeholders the incentive to contribute to a student’s education, that other forms of financing do not? Policy makers, practitioners, as well as theoreticians can benefit from the ideas and the findings of the study. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Science undergraduates’ timely degree completion (TDC) has become increasingly important for students themselves, universities, and society, due to issues such as cost, efficiency, and productivity, respectively. This study investigated the potential effect of several variables on TDC of Bachelor of Science (BSc) students at an Australian research-intensive university. Results showed that two time-dependent variables (TDVs)—gender and Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR)—predicted TDC. Two time-independent variables (TIVs)—the number of discipline majors and specific year level academic achievement—also predicted TDC. Students who completed on time had a significantly higher mean weighted average mark (WAM) than non-TDC students, for each year of study, and more females than males completed their BSc in a timely manner. The primary determinants of TDC were gender, number of discipline majors, and WAM at each of years 2 and 3. Our conceptual model of TDC indicates the predictive interrelationships among these TIVs and TDVs. A more informed understanding of the study’s outcomes among university stakeholders has considerable potential to enhance the engagement, scaffolding, achievement, and TDC of science undergraduates. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, the relationship between leaders and stakeholders is analysed. Specifically, the point of interest is the role played by the stakeholders in modifying leaders behaviour. Stakeholders influence is expressed by their attributes (power, legitimacy and urgency), and the expressions of participative leadership are consult, autocracy, joint decision and delegation. After a review of the questions a model is proposed, and with the aim of applying it in a specific context, a questionnaire is presented, validated and applied. With a relational approach and from a subjective perspective, perceptions of a sample of leaders from public universities in Manizales (Colombia) were collected. A first group of constructs was formed, including the university stakeholders attributes mentioned above. A second group of constructs collects their relevance. Reliability of constructs was measured using Cronbach alpha, and its values indicate that is feasible to measure effectively the proposed constructs. It is concluded that the questionnaire has the internal consistency and reliability for assessing the university stakeholders’ attributes. In the analysis, it has been considered that stakeholders are determined by the organizational context and that relevance of the attributes are the result of leaders perceptions. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Working it out: Will the improved management of leaky bodies in the workplace create a dialogue between medical sociology and disability studies?

ABSTRACT: This article focuses on the workplace as a significant site of convergence between the disciplines of medical sociology and disability studies. As disability remains on the margins of sociological exploration and theorising relating to health and work, disabled workers remain on the margins of the workforce, subject to disproportionate rates of unemployment, under employment and workplace mistreatment. The article focuses on the experiences of people with ‘leaky bodies’, focussing specifically on employees who experience troubling menstruation and/or have gynaecological health conditions. It brings together data from three studies conducted between 2017 and 2020; interviews with disabled academics (n = 75), university staff with gynaecological health conditions (n = 23), and key stakeholders in universities (n = 36) (including university executives, line managers and human resources staff). These studies had separate, but linked foci, on the inaccessibility of workplaces, managing gynaecological health conditions at work and supporting disabled people at work respectively. Drawing on the Social Relational Model of disability and theories of embodiment, we explore the experiences and management of workers with leaky bodies in UK University workplaces. Data illustrates how workplace practices undermine embodied experiences of workers with ‘leaky’ bodies by maintaining workplaces which ignore their material reality. We highlight that addressing embodied needs alongside acknowledging disabled people as an oppressed political category represents a theoretical meeting point for disability studies and medical sociology. © 2022 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: Student-led peer review can be a powerful learning experience for both giver and receiver, developing evaluative judgment, critical thinking, and collaborative skills that are highly transferable across disciplines and professions. Its success depends on purposeful planning and scaffolding to promote student ownership of the process. With intentional and consistent implementation, peer review can engage students in course content and promote deep learning, while also increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of faculty assessment.Based on the authors’ extensive experience and research, this book provides a practical introduction to the key principles, steps, and strategies to implement student peer review – sometimes referred to as “peer critique” or “workshopping”. It addresses common challenges that faculty and students encounter. The authors offer an easy-to-follow and rigorously tested three-part protocol to use before, during, and after a peer review session, and advice on adapting each step to individual courses.The process is applicable across all disciplines, content types, and modalities, face-to-face and online, synchronous and asynchronous. Instructors can guide students in peer review in one course, across two or more courses that are team-taught, or across programs or curriculums. When instructors, students, and university stakeholders create a culture of peer review, it enhances learning benefits for students and allows faculty to share pedagogical resources.Student peer review is a high-impact pedagogy that’s easily implemented, inculcates lifelong learning skills in students, and relieves the assessment burden on faculty as students collaborate to improve their own work. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Although quality assurance (QA) in higher education has been well established for many years, the world of QA is changing. This timely book takes an insightful look from a nonprofit sector perspective at how these changes are impacting accreditation of higher education institutions. Using empirical data on agencies within the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), Stefan Handke provides a thorough review of external assessments carried out by these agencies and reveals the transformation of nonprofit organisations with a public interest orientation into business-like organisations. The book further examines the negative impact on one of the most important functions of QA agencies: the creation of trust and how a change in the rules for external QA is required to alleviate this issue. Forward-thinking, the book also highlights the implications of these rule changes and the importance of them to ensure the survival of accreditation agencies. The expert analysis of the data within this book will be an invaluable resource for those working within QA agencies as well as stakeholders in higher education and researchers in the nonprofit sector. Students studying in the fields of public management and organisation studies will also find this book instructive and informative. © Stefan Handke 2023. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Is dance a sport? Is dance an art? Can dance be categorized as both? The controversy surrounding dance's categorization has been an ongoing debate since the early 1970s. With no definite conclusion to this debate, dancers do not have a clear designation as either artists and/or athletes. As such, unresolved challenges remain in the perceived value and significance of dance, particularly in postsecondary contexts. These challenges have significant implications for competitive dancers in postsecondary contexts, as their experiences as student-athletes and opportunities for participation in sport contexts are largely impacted by conceptualizations of dance by various stakeholders in university athletics. This research examined perceptions surrounding dance as a sport, art, or a combination of both in universities across Ontario, Canada. Competitive dancers, dance coaches, and athletic department staff in postsecondary contexts participated in semi-structured interviews to share their individual beliefs, knowledge, and understandings about competitive dance and the ways dancers occupy spaces as artists and athletes. Most participants stated they viewed dance as both an art and a sport but demonstrated tension in how dancers occupied spaces as legitimate athletes within postsecondary institutions. While participants indicated openness to the idea of dance as a sport and dancers as athletes, the ways in which this was attainable at the university-level was hindered by various institutional and systemic barriers. © 2023 International Journal of Sport and Society.All rights reserved

ABSTRACT: Introduction: Customer-centered management theory has considerable potential for increasing the quality of higher education (HE) in China and promoting its sustainable development. Methods: This study applied customer-centered enterprise management theory to develop an HE stakeholder satisfaction scale based on data from 1,654 students, teachers, and other staff members, including human resources personnel. Results: The three-part stakeholder satisfaction survey consists of the China University Student Satisfaction Scale, the China University Teacher and Staff Satisfaction Scale, and the China University Graduate Human Resources Department Satisfaction Scale. All three subscales were valid, reliable, and can be used to foster management innovation, although they require adjustments to improve their coverage of different HE environments. Discussion: Organizational self-assessment based on customer-centered corporate management theory has much to contribute to the quality and sustainability of China’s HE systems.

ABSTRACT: In response to challenges emerging in society, universities are searching for ways to innovate their courses through novel institutional educational policies and practices. Those efforts, however, are often not informed by knowledge about course innovation characteristics university-wide, and are often not supported by processes of reflection questioning the ‘who’, ‘how’ and ‘for what’ of course innovations. This study applied the multifaceted analytical Course Innovation Framework (CIF) in order to explore characteristics of a large set of intended course innovations in a higher education institution in the Netherlands. The application of the CIF enabled a descriptive analysis of multiple characteristics of the intended course innovations. This analysis unveiled university-wide course innovation trends, upon which university stakeholders reflected in order to responsibly guide and transform policy and practices. The study findings show how the application of the CIF helps to gather situated knowledge on university-wide innovation trends, and how reflection on these trends empowers stakeholders to deliberate the culture and values of educational innovation they wish to promote within their institution. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This paper voices the opinions of international students’ from China and India, and highlights the intentional process of integrating their perceptions of internationalization into a strategic service delivery plan. Data on those perceptions were analysed using a probabilistic model. We clustered 766 international students’ opinions into categories that enabled us to determine the main ideas that constituted their perceptions. The findings enabled us to draw comparisons between two major sending countries and to formulate a series of recommendations for stakeholders in higher education institutions that receive Chinese and Indian students, as well as for policymakers. Primary differences relate to factors such as learning and internship opportunities for Chinese students and service provision for Indian ones. In conclusion, this study offers the next step in the analysis of Chinese and Indian international students’ needs providing with an innovative way of determining students concerns with a view to empowering them within the internationalization process of higher education institutions. © 2021, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: University social responsibility requires dialogue with society and university activity. In the case of responsible research and innovation, this can involve interacting with society, listening to its needs, promoting its development and strengthening its capacity for autonomous progress. But does this dialogue actually take place? The aim of this paper is to describe the current state of communication between researchers and the stakeholders in university research. The study is based on a content analysis of interviews with 107 research groups in five European countries. The results point to four dialogue models, from the absence of communication to the consensual and symmetrical dialogue, a clear minority in the study sample. The arguments researchers give lead us to conclude that the way they understand research prevails over social responsibility. Finally, we present some strategies which could be used to promote a change of perspective towards socially responsible research. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This is the introduction to a Special Issue which addresses the rationales for and practices of the internationalisation of higher education and research in Europe and Eurasia. The contributors look at a variety of activities within internationalisation, such as collaborative degree/joint programmes, student and staff mobility, and research collaborations. In particular, the articles examine how and why rationales, or motivations and goals for internationalisation, vary or coincide at different levels, for example at the supranational (e.g. regional), national, institutional, programme and individual level. This Special Issue pays a special attention to the political environment in which the internationalisation takes place, and how the given environment–e.g. formal political institutions, or policies–encourages, enables or prevents the internationalisation of higher education and research. The contributors focus on internal university stakeholders relevant to the internationalisation, relations between different internal stakeholders and/or their interplay with key external stakeholders. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Black women endure intersectional oppression from racism and sexism, but research suggests they are often erased from conversations centering on racism and sexism due to their proximity to White women and Black men. The erasure of Black women translates into the college environment and at Predominately White Institutions (PWIs). In the classroom, Black women have reported feeling inferior due to the minimization of their knowledge and expertise, gender and racial stereotypes, and microaggressions. Black women have also reported hypervisibility and hyperinvisibility resulting from being one of few Black students in their courses. Beyond the classroom, many Black women feel out of place due to the lack of Black students and staff, the lack of race and gender-affirming campus-related activities, and disproportionate resources. It is critical to consider the factors that assist Black female students in thriving in higher education. This chapter informs higher education stakeholders who can address the obstacles Black female students navigate at PWIs to promote thriving. © 2023 by IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: Background Higher education institutions need to put change management as a pivotal part of their strategy. The challenge is to effectively contextualize existing change management models to the respective work environment. Failing to properly adapt existing models to match the intricacies of the environment could lead to plenty of setbacks. For such a contextualization to take place, gauging employees’ engagement and satisfaction becomes of paramount importance. As such, the overall purpose of the current study is to explore the perception of employees of a medical and health sciences university in Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, in relation to change management and agility, and to showcase how the captured perspectives can be systemically interpreted to inform decision-making in the context of the study. Method This research study relied on a sequential mixed methods design, which started with an exploration of the perception of Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences (MBRU) leaders. Qualitative data was collected through a focus group session and was inductively analysed (based on constructivist epistemology). The output of the qualitative analysis contributed to the development of the quantitative data collection tool. The quantitative data was analysed by SPSS-version-27. Findings The qualitative analysis generated three key themes: Trigger, Execution, and Results, along with a thorough outline of lessons learned and opportunities for improvement. The Cronbach’s Alpha reliability score was 92.8%. The percentage of the total average of agreement was 72.3%, and it appeared that 83.2% of the variance can be explained by the instrument (p<0.001). Conclusion The current study generated a novel conceptual framework that can be leveraged by educational leadership and administration to reinforce their decisions and optimize their agility in terms of managing change. The study also introduces a data collection tool which captures the perception of higher education stakeholders regarding the way their respective institutions handle change. This tool proved to be reliable and valid in the context of the study. © 2023 Ezzeddine et al.

ABSTRACT: Various institutions across the world encourage young people to get involved in community development initiatives and set up small businesses that contribute to the sustainability of society. There is a growing body of literature suggesting that Enactus International is a key stakeholder in this endeavor, as university students’ transformational innovations are developed and exported through Enactus-established collaborations. However, further investigation is required to identify how this phenomenon works. Previous studies have not explored Enactus student teams’ sustainability practices in relation to global goals, and most were limited to the context of a particular institution. As a result, this article examines the relationship between the Enactus sustainability initiative and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, thus identifying critical lessons for South African higher education institutions as well as HEIs in other nations facing comparable circumstances. A focused review methodology is used in this analysis to assess the Enactus global sustainability initiative’s alignment with the SDGs, which involves a comprehensive search of the Web of Science and Scopus databases to identify relevant articles. As the year 2030 approaches, the authors warn that university stakeholders’ resistance to change and knowledge gaps about sustainability practices, as well as other limiting factors identified in this study, may impede the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals in the country. This study intends to encourage higher education institutions as change agents, stimulating them to take the lead in overcoming obstacles to the attainment of the SDGs by 2030. The study illuminates cogent approaches necessary for HEIs to create a more sustainable world. It specifically highlights the multidisciplinary perspective and collaborative opportunities offered by SDG-driven organizations. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The spread and influence of older European higher education models and the current Bologna Process (BP) is strongly linked to its colonial and neocolonial hegemony. However, the 1999 convergence of European models under the umbrella of the BP reform has had implications beyond the colonial and neocolonial spheres, with its effects impacting even the well-established and reputable education systems of North America. Unlike the countries of Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia Pacific, and the United States did not have any reasons to embrace the BP models. However, they are indirectly affected by it. The international nature of academe, characterized by cooperation and exchanges, has made it impossible for United States tertiary education systems to avoid the effects of the European BP reform entirely. Student and faculty mobility, transferability of degrees, and joint and dual degree offerings have increased significantly as a result of the “external dimension” objectives of the Bologna reform. The highly globalized higher education market is characterized by partnerships and exchanges, including competition between European and the United States colleges and universities over international students. The BP ultimately has and will likely continue to influence the calculations of higher education stakeholders in the United States. © 2021 Trustees of Boston University.

ABSTRACT: Community-based learning and teaching in higher education, and other versions of it, such as service learning, are now part of many curricula worldwide. In the UK, there is a growing community of practitioners interested in student learning in partnership with local communities. With this expansion, however, there is little institution-based research which ‘looks within’, in terms of shared understanding and supporting this type of experiential learning ‘at scale’. Within the context of increasing interdisciplinary interest by those developing curricula beyond the traditional home of engaged research and teaching (for example, in urban studies and sociology), we undertook an institution-wide study to discover the shared understandings of community-based learning and teaching, including the potential barriers to, and opportunities for, community-based learning and teaching approaches. In this article, we share insights from a series of 20 university stakeholder interviews, which involved academic teachers, engagement professionals and those supporting learning and teaching. We used a ‘students-as-partners’ approach, where students interested in community-based learning took the leading role in the qualitative study. Our findings reveal the values and expectations, formal learning benefits and infrastructural considerations to implement this type of learning as part of future-facing curricula. We also provide recommendations for universities seeking to develop their own approaches towards facilitating community-based learning and teaching. © 2023, Rehan Shah, Anne Preston and Elena Dimova.

ABSTRACT: Understanding the effectiveness of the implementation of higher education policies could help stakeholders make informed decisions. As a relatively new policy, research on the evaluation of the reformed national college enrollment policy—Strengthening Basic Disciplines Plan (SBDP), especially from the perspective of policy innovation and implementation is limited. This study attempts to evaluate SBDP at an early stage, thereby understanding how effectively SBDP has been implemented and what its innovations are. Utilizing the policy documentation and institutional admission documents, this study operated qualitative data using a semi-quantitative method, primarily focusing on two comparisons: the SBDP policy documentation vs. institutional SBDP admission documents, and institutional SBDP vs. Independent Enrollment Policy (IEP) admission documents. Results showed that most pilot institutions regulate SBDP admission documents in accordance with the policy documentation. However, institutional divergence in practical implementations still exists, even under centralized governance. In addition, four major demand-oriented innovations such as cultivating talents in basic disciplines and cultivation strategies in SBDP were found, compared to IEP. These findings have implications in helping Chinese higher education stakeholders to effectively implement SBDP and achieve sustainable talent cultivation for national strategies. © 2023 by the author.

University sustainability league tables: Institutionalising 'nature deficit disorder'?

ABSTRACT: The underlying assumption behind this paper's aim is that, while universities are being rated highly for their performance around popular, externally accredited sustainability league table criteria, such as implementing management systems approaches (e.g. IS014001) and carbon management and performance, there is little evidence that these explicit and visible tick-box criteria are radically changing behaviour towards sustainability among universities' stakeholders. This paper attempts to rectify this situation by focusing on the UK's People and Planet's 'Green League Table'. It endeavours to challenge even the leading universities and organisations to reflect on the question of whether they are fostering a climate followship culture of demotivated, reactive, detached, efficient and self-interested bureaucrats. Alternatively, by framing the climate and wider sustainability threat in fundamentally different ways, could universities engage a broader range of stakeholders to foster a sustainability transitional and transdisciplinary change? It will draw its inspiration from evolutionary psychology, introducing the organising root metaphor of the 'biophilic university', defined as: 'A university which restores an emotional affinity with the natural environment'. This metaphor is named after the biophilia hypothesis originally proposed by Stephen Kellert. © Greenleaf Publishing 2012.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of this paper was to present an attempt to build an innovative and comprehensive system of gathering and analysing reliable, accurate and up-to-date feedback on employability of academic graduates in Poland. After a literature review on the nature of the mismatch between the labour market requirements and the knowledge and skills of higher education graduates, as well as challenges connected with obtaining feedback from graduates, a case study devoted to collecting and analysing labour market stakeholders' feedback undertaken by a small faculty of a non-public academy in Warsaw, Poland is presented. A sample of 31 opinions of the faculty's graduates was gathered and analysed, in the form of an arithmetic mean, minimum and maximum values and cross-plot charts. The main conclusion of both the literature review and the case study is that the labour market highly values technical, especially IT skills and business-related soft skills, such as team-working. The two main challenges for the academic decision-makers are to develop curricula that would foster the development of the desired knowledge and skills and to build effective communication channels with all their stakeholders. A further, more comprehensive research into the matter will be worth conducting.  Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

ABSTRACT: Background: Scholars agree that reciprocity is a cornerstone of service-learning and community engagement (SLCE); however, engagement with this concept varies widely in practice and across disciplines. To enhance the potential of SLCE to fulfill its promise for societal impact, engineering education must understand how reciprocity is achieved, recognize barriers that inhibit its progress, and identify strategies for how it can be strengthened. Purpose: We performed this review to understand the ways reciprocity is articulated in the engineering SLCE literature. Drawing from these articulations, we examined the extent of engagement with reciprocity toward providing insights into the design and assessment of SLCE efforts for reciprocity. Scope/Method: We performed a systematic literature review on engineering SLCE at institutes of higher education. Following an established approach to identify and synthesize articles, we developed deductive codes by distilling three well-articulated orientations of reciprocity. We then analyzed the operationalization of reciprocity in the literature. Results: The literature demonstrated varying degrees of reciprocity. Minimally reciprocal efforts centered university stakeholders. In contrast, highly reciprocal partnerships explicitly addressed the nature of engagement with communities. Findings provide insights into the breadth of practice within reciprocity present in engineering SLCE. Further, analysis suggests that our codes and levels of reciprocity can function as a framework that supports the design and evaluation of reciprocity in SLCE efforts. Conclusions: Our review suggests that to enact more equitable SLCE, researchers and practitioners must intentionally conceptualize reciprocity, translate it into practice, and make visible the ways in which reciprocity is enacted within their SLCE efforts. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The editors of Education as the Driving Force for Equity of the Marginalized (2022) explore the text for implications for teacher preparation. Authors of each chapter focus on a specific country and explore the role education has or can play in promoting equity. The impact of oppressive systems (societal forces that marginalize particular groups) is explored with a focus on how to mitigate such systems. Tseng et al.'s promotion for social change framework guided the editors' design and execution of this international text. Through qualitative meta-synthesis of the chapters, the editors have analyzed the book's content for themes that can be translated into actionable recommendations framed within the promotion for social change framework. These recommendations are targeted toward a range of education pre-college and higher education stakeholders. © 2023, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: There is a worldwide interest in developing quantitative faculty members’ activity evaluation models. However, implementing a fair and reliable model is challenging. Without capable and high-quality faculty members, no education improvement effort subsequently can succeed. Based on the gap analysis of the literature, lack of a quantitative faculty member assessment model might affect teaching and scholarly performance and lead to undesirable effects. Therefore, most of the existing metrics assessment models do not capture the full range of activities that support and transmit knowledge to students. The main objective of the current research is to develop a practical, comprehensive and flexible statistical Target-Based Engagement assessment model of faculty members that considers both the specific faculty needs and the academic unit management concerns. A mathematical relationship between one or more random and additional non-random variables was used to develop the model. Descriptive and inferential statistical methods were applied in the data analysis. The Target-Based Engagement model has seven interconnected aspects and three subsequent modules. It is a robust statistical framework for automatic faculty assessment. The results of this model are beneficial for faculty assessment in addition to having wellaligned key performance indicators inside the different levels of the institution. The model helps in supporting different strategic decision-making of the institution and is considered as a long-term improvement method in the academic profession. Creating a vision for future faculty assessment statistical models will improve the faculty performance and enhance the performance of all higher education stakeholders. © 2019, (publisher Name).

ABSTRACT: The chapter seeks to explore the various roles played by higher education stakeholders during the different phases in the transformation of higher education in South Africa since the onset of the new democracy. These stakeholders can be divided into internal and external stakeholders as their role and impact on the system is different. In examining the role played by stakeholders in South African higher education, the approach used here is that of a chronological account, starting with the apartheid era. In this case then, the history of South African higher education is very instructive to the current state of affairs. The first period analysed here is predemocracy including the colonial and apartheid eras. The next period is the one that I describe as the reconstruction era as it is during this period that all facets of South Africa were being reconstructed. This period was to be followed by a number of changes in the socioeconomic environment that, in turn, influenced the higher education system. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

ABSTRACT: Tutoring contributes to student performance. However, the institutional factors that affect tutoring effectiveness have been explored to a limited extent. This study assessed institutional factors affecting tutors' effectiveness and support strategies to improve their function. Interview data among twenty tutors in the Business and Economics faculty in a higher education institution in South Africa was analysed using inductive thematic analysis to output themes emerging from the data. Findings revealed that technical issues, unclear instructions, inadequate resources and training influenced tutors' performance. Regular engagement/communication, tutor workshops, training tailored to specific tutors' needs and challenges, timely provision of tutorial materials, incentives and supporting infrastructure could improve tutors' effectiveness. The findings are beneficial to higher education stakeholders in developing measures to ensure effective tutoring for students. There is scope for future studies on the same topic to elicit views when tutoring is conducted face-to-face as this study was impacted by the covid-19 pandemic. © 2023 International Conference on Higher Education Advances.

ABSTRACT: Stakeholders in higher education, both internally and externally, have increasingly called on the profession of student affairs to focus attention on and implement an evidence-based culture. For decades, these stakeholders have issued urgent appeals for including assessment in a more formal way in divisions of student affairs. Across higher education, administrators want to be certain that every dollar spent has a high return on investment in order to benefit students. Stakeholders want to be assured that the programs and services involved in student affairs are highly effective and efficient in contributing to the mission of higher education. Not only parents and families, but also donors and federal and state agencies are demanding accountability for their dollars. However, the demand is not just from others; it is part of who we are as a profession. Most student affairs professionals we know want to provide highly effective and excellent programs and services that help students succeed in college as well as beyond graduation. As professionals, we need to tell our stories in ways that use evidence to reflect our influence on student retention, graduation, and overall success. These goals are why we wrote this book, to provide a direct and practical message about creating a culture of assessment in student affairs. © 2023 Taylor and Francis.

ABSTRACT: Legislative professionalism is central to the politico-institutional context of postsecondary policy adoption in state governments. The core argument in existing research is that as legislative professionalism increases, structural capacity for decision-making increases. Evidence for this argument is mixed, exclusively quantitative, and assumes a bureaucratic logic. The goal of this study is to deepen understanding of legislative professionalism by examining how policy stakeholders perceive the postsecondary policy environment in a “citizen legislature.” The study draws on 26 in-depth interviews with higher education stakeholders in Nevada. The findings contribute empirically to the literature by demonstrating that legislative professionalism can be understood in terms of the meanings assigned distinctive legislative environments. The results also make a conceptual contribution to this literature by showing how loose coupling in interorganizational relations and bounded rationality shape the policy environment—in ways that yield benefits for some institutions and disadvantages for others. © The Author(s) 2023.

I appreciate the willingness of the Editors to allow me to write in such a reflective and discursive way. The chapter outlines a problem, posits some theoretical explanations but offers no concrete solution. The kind of comprehensive change in students' experience of university learning that I believe in seems hardly closer now than when I adopted it in its primitive form as my mission more than thirty years ago. Perhaps it appeared to be getting closer at times but more recent years have seen the dream fade. This chapter attempts to analyze why and to ponder whether such an outcome is inevitable. That self-centred portrayal of the problem will be balanced by further analysis using distributed leadership theory1. I want to emphasize that the change I am talking about is not concerned simply with the degree to which discussion of teaching and learning among stakeholders in university education has increased per se (it has increased considerably) but rather whether progressive changes have been made to the learning environment with consequential, beneficial effects on learning outcomes. There has been a lot of discussion in recent decades but the rhetoric has not always been matched by the outcomes. Also, the nature of the activities undertaken by graduates has become much broader, in some situations much less sophisticated, as universities become institutions of mass education, and in other situations more complex and demanding. In a sense the goal posts for university undergraduate education have shifted and it is no longer clear where they are standing. That has made the task of creating the ideal learning environment more difficult to envisage and design If you continue with your reading of this chapter, doing so may catalyze your thinking and encourage you to reflect on whether the problem described is real and whether you have a way of solving it. My goal is that you, the reader, should use what I write to see if you and others can do in the future what, in the last few decades, my colleagues and I could not. © 2009 Springer US.

ABSTRACT: Under the raging pandemic, all stakeholders in higher education were forced to respond to unexpected educational changes. Universities shut down suddenly, students had no choice but studied online, and faculty members were forced to teach online without adequate preparation. Under these circumstances, students’ actual learning experiences and the quality of online education become a major concern worldwide. This study adopts a quantitative approach to investigate Taiwanese students’ perceptions of their online learning experiences during the breakout of the pandemic to discuss the challenges as well as the inequality issues in terms of online learning. A total of 517 valid responses were analyzed in this study. There are two major findings. First, nearly half of the respondents deemed online learning to be less effective than the traditional face-to-face mode. Second, students’ educational background and family income significantly impact online learning effectiveness. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

ABSTRACT: This research examines college students' entrepreneurial inclinations using TPB, self-efficacy, and the crisis effect. It also examines the crisis effect's moderating influence post-pandemic. A unique analytical technique using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to evaluate the model's resilience. 310 Indian university students were surveyed online. Self-efficacy is a crucial predictor of entrepreneurial tendencies among higher education students. ANN analysis confirms SEM findings that self-efficacy and perceived behaviour control shape entrepreneurial desires. Despite its negative impact, the crisis effect doesn't appear to affect entrepreneurs' objectives. The crisis impact moderates all exogenous and endogenous factors except subjective norms and entrepreneurial goals, the research finds. The research also shows that students' education and geography affect their entrepreneurial inclinations. Gender, however, has little control. Policymakers and higher education administrators could boost entrepreneurial ambitions by fostering students' self-efficacy and perceived behaviour control. Understanding these elements allows higher education stakeholders to create targeted interventions and support systems to foster college student entrepreneurship. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Organisational conflict is a pervasive issue in university systems, particularly in South Africa, which can harm the work environment and productivity if left unaddressed. This research investigates how organisational culture affects conflict management practices among university stakeholders and proposes measures to establish a culture that promotes effective conflict resolution. Drawing on the competing values framework (CVF) and social identity theory (SIT), the study adopts a transformative paradigm perspective, utilising a participatory research design to encourage collaborative problem-solving. Ten prominent stakeholders were purposefully selected from a specific university, including two deans, two heads of departments, two lecturers, two student leaders, and two non-teaching staff members. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather data, which were then analysed thematically. The results indicate that a culture of respect, inclusivity, and openness, as well as training and resources, significantly affect conflict resolution. Consequently, open communication, active listening, collaboration, and a culture of diversity, inclusivity, and respect were identified as practical approaches to create a culture of effective conflict resolution. The study concludes that establishing a culture that promotes effective conflict resolution in universities necessitates prioritising open communication, active listening, and collaboration and fostering a culture of diversity, inclusivity, and respect. © 2023 Conscientia Beam.

ABSTRACT: South African Universities faced an unforeseen crisis in the form of the #FeesMustFall (#FMF) movement. The Executive Management of the affected Universities was criticized for how the crisis was handled. Due to the significant cost (over R1 billion) to the higher education sector, not just in fiscal losses, but the loss of life, the investment into crisis management would be justified. Crisis management is a business action that includes planning and organising to prepare for and to respond to threats to business activities. Reviewing the literature identified a void regarding the crisis management competencies needed by the Executive Management as perceived by stakeholders. This exploratory study made use of a mixed methodology research design. A self-administered questionnaire incorporating open-ended questions was used to identify and explore the competencies perceived by the stakeholders as important during times of crisis. Simple descriptive statistics were used to identify the top management competencies needed in a time of crisis as perceived by the stakeholders. This was compared with the findings in the literature. The study identified 10 management competencies perceived by stakeholders of which eight competencies are consistent with crisis management competencies found in the literature. © 2023 The Authors.

ABSTRACT: The absence of academic writing instruction and the ever-growing requirements for Czech doctoral students to publish in prestigious journals English have created a gap between the doctoral students' skills and the requirements they need to comply with. In this paper, we briefly summarize the results of a needs analysis survey we had administered to doctoral students at a Czech engineering university prior to developing academic writing and information literacy courses for these students. But for these courses to catch on, we need to disseminate knowledge about writing development and pedagogies to audiences and higher education stakeholders who are largely unaware that writing can be taught because writing development and composition studies are not culturally embedded in the Czech education system. To draw attention to the courses and highlight their importance and appeal, we opted for a geocaching/educaching game and show writing as a process, where students move through different stages on their journey to publication. The game thus creates situations, sending the players to different places along the way, including the library, journal editor's office, or a conference.  © 2020 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: This paper examines three university-community partnership (UCP) projects. Two projects were situated within a Southeastern, lower-income Black community, where the university recently developed a campus, to anchor an education ecosystem. The third project was affiliated with a Northeastern university that is seen as an anchor for the community, within its city limits. The projects and participants were examined not to reveal empirical findings. Still, they were used as a lens that guided the authors’ reflections as agents of color working in UCPs. Utilizing critical autoethnographic narratives, we discuss our motivations for social justice-oriented, engaged work. We also illuminate the real opportunities and challenges in fostering UCPs. We further examine how equity was integrated within the projects by using counterexamples of the common discourses of engagement, which we ultimately identified as a necessary resistance to collaborate within communities authentically. We conclude with a framework to center community stakeholders in UCPs. © 2023 Community Development Society.

ABSTRACT: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant changes in Indonesian higher education to switch the learning activities to online learning. During the online learning implementations, researchers tried to record the changes and discussed the problems they faced. This systematic review aimed to summarize the growth of online learning for Indonesian higher education during the COVID-19 and to describe the connection between trends of online learning’s growth and stakeholders’ interests. Ultimately, this systematic review wanted to forecast the scenario after seeing the overall progress of online learning in higher education institutions in Indonesia. The authors conducted a systematic literature review using PRISMA protocol and collected articles from Google Scholar, EBSCOHost, SAGE, Taylor & Francis, and ProQuest. A total of 1,206 studies were retrieved from all databases. The authors excluded some articles that did not come originally from Indonesia, did not involve participants from universities, and were not empirical research. A final eighty-six articles were collected for analysis. The results revealed that infrastructure, interactivity, and readiness were the three main discussions for all Indonesian higher education stakeholders. The authors provided four scenarios for online learning in Indonesia, and the Cyber Growth scenario was the preferred scenario for higher education in Indonesia. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

ABSTRACT: Secondary–postsecondary partnership reforms have grown in scale and importance throughout the past few decades as part of the national agenda to increase college access, equity, and completion. However, little research has examined the role of the principal in cross-sector partnerships. This qualitative case study explores how one nationally acclaimed principal at an award-winning early college high school made sense of the cross-sector context and negotiated with K–12 and higher education stakeholders to maximize college opportunity for low-income, Latinx, and first-generation students. Our analysis integrates sensemaking and micropolitical theory to identify leadership practices that facilitate effective cross-sector collaboration, with implications for K–12 leadership and cross-sector partnership reform. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Social media has transformed the way in which individuals, groups, businesses, and organizations communicate with each other. The modes and manners in which social media are utilized heavily influence the potential outreach to friends, family members, clients, and other peers within our personal and professional networks. Social media has swept across the higher education landscape on several layers. The way social media is used by higher education stakeholders seems to grow at an exponential rate as time and technology progress. Social media is used for personal interactions and communications, and is increasingly part of the professional repertoire we are expecting higher education graduates to have as an essential skill for employment and networking needs. It is also increasingly used as a means by which higher education curriculum can be and is delivered. Students, faculty members, and administrators are relying more than ever on social media to disseminate their instruction, learning, scholarship, research findings, and outreach initiatives. © 2015, Deane E.

ABSTRACT: Student persistence is of great importance for all stakeholders in higher education. There have been numerous studies using data mining and machine learning tools to predict student persistence. However, very little research has explored individual feature importance and their distinctive roles in predicting individual outcomes. In this study, we compare the predictive performance of two widely used machine learning models, logistic regression, and random forest, and use the SMOTE to improve the model performance. We analyze the feature importance in both aggregated form and their varied impact on individual predictions using a real-world student persistence dataset. In the discussion section, we propose practical approaches for monitoring and predicting student persistence. © 2023, North American Business Press. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Institutions of higher education increasingly engage in internationalization efforts for a variety of reasons. The collection of practices these institutions engage in, which can be called conventional internationalization models (CIM), primarily focus on centralized and institutionalized efforts. This paper reviews typical aspects of CIM, noting their benefits while also spotlighting the costs they entail and the open spaces they leave. The paper then introduces the self-internationalization model (SIM) as a complement and a supplement to CIM. SIM offers a less centralized approach to internationalization, focusing instead on individual initiatives taken by faculty, academic managers, and students. This paper explains the functional aspects of SIM and its comparative advantages and disadvantages vis-à-vis CIM. Furthermore, it provides guidelines for the design and implementation of comprehensive, innovative, flexible, and dynamic internationalization models combining SIM and CIM in a manner that is suitable, convenient, affordable, and beneficial for all stakeholders in higher education institutions. © 2018, Institute of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

Motivation of academics in the Global South: a case from Cambodia higher education
(2023) Journal of Applied Research in Higher Education, 15 (5), pp. 1530 - 1543, Cited 0 times.
DOI: 10.1108/JARHE-08-2022-0241

ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of the article is to examine the motivation of the academics in a developing country, Cambodia, which is an under-researched country in order to look into the satisfaction level of the academics in various aspects of academic profession. This study helps inform policy makers and other stakeholders in higher education in Cambodia about the current status quo of academic profession in Cambodia, which acts to impede the quality of higher education in this country. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a survey design to examine the motivation of academics in a periphery country, Cambodia. The result from an online survey via Microsoft Form of 278 academics currently working at three public universities and four private universities across the country revealed that academics in higher education institutions in Cambodia were satisfied with their job (Mean = 4.1, SD = 0.74) and the organizational culture and value (Mean = 3.9, SD = 0.77), but dissatisfied with their salary (Mean = 3.1, SD = 0.90). The mean score of other variables also skewed toward happiness, yet this mean score remained low (between 3.2 and 3.8). Furthermore, the result from t-test and one-way ANOVA showed no significant difference in job satisfaction between public and private academics and among academics from different employment statuses. Job satisfaction of academics in this study did not come from salary or work environment, but may have come from the flexibility and status quo of academic career in Cambodia, in which the majority of academics have additional job while many others (38% of the participants) treat teaching as their secondary job and at the same time maintain the title as academic or even professor, which is relatively well-respected in Cambodia society, despite poor salary. The complexity of academic career in this context may present major setbacks to the quality of higher education in this periphery country. Findings: This study revealed that although academics in higher education in Cambodia were satisfied with their job and organizational culture and value, they were not satisfied with their work environment and salary. The result from this study indicated that the reason why salary did not determine the satisfaction level of academics was that most of the academics in Cambodia higher education have additional job or business in addition to teaching. Moreover, they have other full-time jobs outside higher education and they can still teach part-time to earn extra income. Research limitations/implications: Since this study generated only 278 responses from academics, these data remain small compared to the whole population. Thus, this may affect the generalization of the finding to the larger population. Practical implications: This study helps fill the existing gaps in literature on higher education in Cambodia and the findings from this study can be used to make informed decision regarding quality of higher education in Cambodia. Social implications: Higher education is a social institution that helps maintain professionalization of all professions and improve students competitiveness. Improving quality of higher education means that academics themselves need to be professional and ethical toward teaching. This research pointed out the unethical practices of academic procession, which in turn, de-professionalize academics and downgrade the quality of higher education in Cambodia.

ABSTRACT: Due to an increase in competitiveness between universities in Indonesia, the implementation of a Smart Campus was needed to be carried out by various universities. Subsequently, this implementation by universities requires a Smart Campus reference model. This Smart Campus model consists of a Higher Education model integrated with a Smart System model. Furthermore, it serves as a reference for the Higher Education model which simulates the enforcement of the Smart Campus model. This study created a Smart Campus measurement model comprising of two parts, namely the maturity level of Digital Transformation and the smartness level. The smartness level measurement is based on smart systems, technology and service quality used to improve the quality of life of university stakeholders. Furthermore, the result of this measurement was that the Digital Twin Smart Campus model provided a baseline for Smart Campus development such as the Digital Transformation of a traditional campus into a Smart Campus. © 2023 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Language curriculum reform can be challenging and demanding. However, it is crucial for the language teaching and learning process. In Thailand, while the reforms in Thai language education aim to address the country's language proficiency problem, there have been limited studies investigating how these reforms are implemented at an institutional level. This sequential exploratory mixed method research investigated the curriculum policy change in a university in Thailand and how such curriculum policy was implemented, impacting students' language proficiency. Using students' pre-test and post-test scores from 1501 first-year students for the academic year 2019–2020 and interviews with seven university stakeholders, the findings point to the dual function of the curriculum policy change. Such curriculum change, specifically on the implementation of English as a medium of instruction (EMI), is geared toward improving students' language proficiency and the university's internationalization. Based on the findings, we argued that a language curriculum reform should be planned and implemented comprehensively by identifying the grassroots issues to achieve a specific purpose. Implications are discussed, and suggestions are offered. © 2022 The Authors

ABSTRACT: The goal of the present study was to examine factors associated with academic self-handicapping in Black students attending a predominantly white university. Factors examined included sociodemographic factors (gender, first-generation college student status); psychological factors (family support, perceived discrimination, Black identity); and academic goal orientation. Participants were 240 Black/African American students who were part of a deidentified dataset from a larger study examining undergraduate student’s personal experiences and psychosocial correlates of academic self-handicapping (mean age 19.20, 107 first-generation students, 96 men, 144 women). First-generation status and gender were not related to academic self-handicapping. Lower family support, higher Black identity positive regard, and higher perceived discrimination were associated with higher academic self-handicapping. Higher self-handicapping was also related to lower mastery orientation, but higher approach and avoidance orientation. In regression models, family support, Black identity positive regard, and approach/avoidance motivation remained unique predictors of academic self-handicapping. Results suggest that higher education stakeholders focus on strategies and systems of supports to minimize self-handicapping. Stakeholders may also consider interventions focused on enhancing racial identity or directly addressing academic self-handicapping tendencies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

ABSTRACT: One of the greatest challenges for medical schools is to rethink, research and adapt technologies for learning and knowledge acquisition to processes of empathic com-munication, social, cultural and professional exchange, and of emotional harmony for university stakeholders. The evaluation of the level of achievement of the competences that physicians need to develop is a fundamental task in their training process. Cell phones and electronic tablets offer a great number of possibilities to include new ways of evaluation and recording of information during the development of students’ competencies. In the framework of evaluations through Entrusted Professional Activities (EPAs), the implementation of mobile applications (Apps) to capture data and provide feedback to students is increasing every day. Studies have been conducted to identify successes and barriers in incorpo-rating Apps to assess EPAs. The purpose of this article is to describe how technologies for learning and knowledge acquisition were incorporated in the implementation of the electronic application “MedAPProc” in the formative evaluation through Entrusted Professional Activities in the medical internship of the Medical Surgeon major of the Faculty of Medicine of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The needs, advantages and limitations of swithcing from paper to electronic formats in order to im-prove and make more efficient the evaluation of students’ competencies performance are described. © 2023, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

ABSTRACT: Internationally, university social responsibility has become a trend that higher education institutions have adopted models or indicators recommended by different organizations, but they are only theoretical models. This statistical and empirical model is a new way to justify which strategies are the most useful and most impactful. The main purpose is a new management model of university social responsibility analyzed to enhance the performance of university students, and the effect that university social responsibility factors have through the actions of higher education institutions in northeastern Mexico. The methodology used was quantitative, descriptive and predictive using multi-variable techniques of structural equations. The sample was 776 students, with which it is possible to prove that the performance of university stakeholders is influenced by the culture of legality of the students as well as their integral formation and by the projects related to the environment and sustainability as well as their application in university and professional life. A contribution is generated to the management of university social responsibility by identifying which factors are the most important to obtain the most significant impact for the stakeholders. © 2021, Czestochowa University of Technology.

ABSTRACT: This paper analyzes the perspectives of college students toward food insecurity and basic needs campus resources. We draw from interviews with 49 students at one university in California’s Inland Empire conducted in 2019. We found that regardless of personal experience with food insecurity, participants were generally reluctant to access resources or disclose their experiences with the campus community. We propose that this food insecurity stigma operates individually, interactionally, and structurally. We also discuss it as a by-product of neoliberal discourses about students “abusing” the system and needing to pull themselves up by the bootstraps. A response from university stakeholders has been to normalize food insecurity and visibilize resource use. While an important strategy to counteract the impact of food insecurity, we argue that normalization has limits in regard to addressing the root causes of food insecurity. Finally, we also illustrate ways that students themselves resist food insecurity stigma. © 2022 Association for the Study of Food and Society (ASFS).

ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present a conceptual model of the development of a relationship between first-generation Latino men while navigating the unchartered waters, or the unknown, of a doctoral program. Drawing from focus groups, we outline the various components (e.g., institutional role and support, resilience, cultural affinity) that contributed to the model of compañerismo and how this cultural phenomenon, in turn, led to the participants’ successful navigation of their graduate education. Compañerismo represents the evolvement from a surface-level friendship to a cultural, personal, and academic support system. Guided by the data, we offer practical implications for higher education stakeholders to better support Latino men and their persistence and retention in doctoral programs. © The Author(s) 2021.

ABSTRACT: Family-centered care (FCC) is widely established as the standard professional practice model in pediatric hospital settings (Arabiat, D., Whitehead, L., Foster, M., Shields, L., & Harris, L. (2018). Parents’ experiences of family centred care practices. Journal of Pediatric Nursing, 42, 39–44. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2018.06.012 ; Espe-Sherwindt, M. (2008). Family-centred practice: Collaboration, competency and evidence. Support for Learning, 23(3), 136–143. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9604.2008.00384.x). It embraces social work values that promote self-determination and family empowerment by positioning family members as partners in healthcare treatment, delivery, and decision-making (Kuo, D. Z., Houtrow, A. J., Arango, P., Kuhlthau, K. A., Simmons, J. M., & Neff, J. M. (2012). Family-centered care: Current applica?tions and future directions in pediatric health care. Maternal and Child Health Journal, 16(2), 297–305. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-011-0751-7). To promote and advance FCC principles, healthcare organizations collaborate with patients and families as lived experience volunteers, or family leaders, to ensure program design and education reflect users’ perspectives and experiences. Despite evidence for its efficacy and uptake (Arabiat, D., Whitehead, L., Foster, M., Shields, L., & Harris, L. (2018). Parents’ experiences of family centred care practices. Journal of Pediatric Nursing, 42, 39–44. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2018.06.012), translating FCC principles into practice can be challenging (McCarthy, E., & Guerin, S. (2022). Family-centred care in early intervention: A systematic review of the processes and out?comes of family-centred care and impacting factors. Child: Care Health and Development, 48(1), 1–32. https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12901). In this paper, we introduce an innovative training program for family leaders that embodies the core principles of FCC. The training program was developed in collaboration with families, healthcare and higher education stakeholders, and engagement specialists by a social worker in a pediatric rehabilitation setting in Toronto, Ontario. The program prepares family leaders to engage in teaching and facilitation roles in healthcare education. The Teaching and Facilitation Course for Family as Faculty is the first program of its kind in Canada and was recently recognized by the Health Standards Organization of Canada as a leading practice in healthcare. Since launching in 2019, over 50 participants connected with healthcare organizations across Ontario have completed the course. Graduates have partnered with educators in designing and facilitating over 85 initiatives and workshops across healthcare and academic institutions. The outcomes of a utilization-focused program evaluation, including the strengths and lessons learned are discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: As industry demands students with a greater technical skillset, experiential learning projects are more critical than ever in developing required technical expertise. Employing a value co-creation model at a midwestern university, the authors implemented a project to develop students’ digital marketing skills, secure certifications in digital marketing, and simultaneously benefit the university community by developing e-mail communications for graduate programs. Through a course-based project, the authors examine the influence of iterative project submissions and frequent feedback as a tool to enhance both student and university employee learning. Results show value co-creative projects with a university client offers benefits to both students and the broader university community. For students, multiple practice iterations with feedback from university stakeholders increased student confidence, knowledge, and competence. For university participants, reviewing iterative project submissions was beneficial in developing marketing skills and stimulating innovative solutions beyond the scope of the student projects. Challenges related to the study design and limitations are also discussed. © 2023 Society for Marketing Advances.

ABSTRACT: A pragmatic approach was used to explore the extent to which four selected social science degree programs were relevant for the skill needs of the job market in Zambia. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 162 participants using interviews and questionnaires. The SPSS version 24 and Atlas. Ti Version 8 were used to analyse and interpret data within the framework of the Capability Approach. The findings reveal that the relevance of each of the four social science degree programs depend on how key stakeholders in higher education and the labour market perceive them and that graduate employability was affected by factors such as the need and importance of social sciences to the labour market; employer and student perceptions of employability skills in the degree programs; demand for the programs; graduate work readiness, and the availability of graduate job prospects. It could be concluded that although all four social science degree programs were important, their relevance to the needs of Zambia’s labour market varied from program to program. © 2021 Deakin University.

ABSTRACT: This study aims to investigate the influence of gamification on students’ engagement, learning effectiveness, and satisfaction in higher education, as well as the function of engagement and learning effectiveness in moderating the connection. Data were obtained quantitatively from 306 undergraduate and graduate students in Vietnam who participated in gamified lectures. The links between gamification, student engagement, learning effectiveness, and satisfaction were investigated using structural equation modeling. The results suggested that challenge and enjoyment directly influenced students’ engagement and satisfaction. Additionally, the presence of challenge directly affected learning effectiveness. Engagement and learning effectiveness served as mediators between gamification and students’ satisfaction. Educational institutions, instructors, and academics may use gamification to improve students’ engagement, satisfaction, and learning effectiveness, leading to more inspirational and successful learning experiences in higher education. This study provides significant insights for higher education stakeholders and encourages instructors and institutions to adopt creative teaching methodologies that meet the demands of current students. Adoption of gamification can result in more dynamic and engaging learning environments, which will boost students’ experiences and overall educational quality. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Due to the high expense of obtaining and accessing scientific research, readers with diverse financial abilities are not offered equal opportunities. This study investigates the preferences for journal access types among Arab university academics and explores the implications of publishing research articles in open access vs closed access journals in low- and lower-middle income countries. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey and an in-person focus group consisting of 74 scholars from Arab institutions throughout the Arab World were conducted. Findings: Findings show that most professors at Arab universities favour open access publication without author fees. The results also show that this method of publishing research will help these nations advance by giving all citizens equal access to information and providing researchers with a good opportunity to be read and cited, which contributes to the overall progress of science. Originality/value: This topic has not been investigated yet, and it is of great importance to university professors and stakeholders in higher education institutions in the Arab world. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: While education is based on the broad assumption that what one learns here can transfer over there- across critical transitions - what do we really know about the transfer of knowledge?The question is all the more urgent at a time when there are pressures to “unbundle” higher education to target learning particular subjects and skills for occupational credentialing to the detriment of integrative education that enables students to make connections and integrate their knowledge, skills and habits of mind into a adaptable and critical stance toward the worldThis book - the fruit of two-year multi-institutional studies by forty-five researchers from twenty-eight institutions in five countries - identifies enabling practices for, and five essential principles about, writing transfer that should inform decision-making by all higher education stakeholders about how to generally promote the transfer of knowledge.This collection concisely summarizes what we know about writing transfer and explores the implications of writing transfer research for universities’ institutional decisions about writing across the curriculum requirements, general education programs, online and hybrid learning, outcomes assessment, writing-supported experiential learning, e-portfolios, first-year experiences, and other higher education initiatives. This volume makes writing transfer research accessible to administrators, faculty decision makers, and other stakeholders across the curriculum who have a vested interest in preparing students to succeed in their future writing tasks in academia, the workplace, and their civic lives, and offers a framework for addressing the tensions between competency-based education and the integration of knowledge so vital for our society. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Aim/Purpose This study aims to examine the roles of key traits of m-university services and their users in promoting two crucial post-adoption outcomes of these services; namely, continuance usage intention and perceived value. Background M-university (i.e., a university providing services via mobile technologies) has gained a great interest in the higher education sector as a driver of new business models and innovative service offerings. However, its assessment has been greatly overlooked, especially in evaluating the factors that drive the stakeholders’ continuance intention to use it and the determinants of its post-adoption perceived value. Consequently, research efforts undertaking such assessment facets empirically are highly required. Methodology An integrated research model that enables such assessment was developed and evaluated using a quantitative research methodology. Accordingly, data were collected using a formulated closed-ended survey questionnaire. The target population consisted of the academic staff of a Saudi public university that has witnessed an extensive adoption of m-university services. The obtained data (i.e., 207 fully completed responses) were evaluated using the structural equation modeling approach. Contribution To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that gains the chance to provide the research community and m-service providers with new knowledge and understanding about the predictors that drive the continuance usage intention and value of m-university services. Findings The findings showed that all of the examined traits of m-university services and their users (i.e., reliability, usability, customization, self-efficacy, and involvement) are having positive roles in promoting the continuance intention to use these services, while only two traits (i.e., reliability and involvement) contribute significantly to augmenting the perceived value. Recommendations The study recommends developing effective design and implementation specifi for Practitioners cations that strengthen the contributions of the examined traits in the post-adoption stage of m-university services. Recommendations Further studies should be devoted to addressing the notable need to assess the for Researchers factors influencing the adoption of m-university services, as well as to explore which ones are having significant roles in the attainment of post-adoption outcomes. Impact on Society The empirical insights provided by the present study are essential for both university stakeholders and mobile service providers in their endeavors to improve the key aspects of the anticipated post-adoption outcomes of the provided services. Future Research Further empirical investigations are needed to examine the roles of more m-university services and user traits in achieving a broad range of post-adoption outcomes of such services. © 2022 Informing Science Institute.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: As a new channel for agricultural extension, university-based agricultural extension is changing the traditional pattern of agricultural extension in China. This study reveals the mechanism through which policy affects the performance of university-based agricultural extension. Design/methodology/approach: Based on Rhodes’ policy network analysis, this study analyses the interactive relationships between the stakeholders in university-based agricultural extension. Taking 12 institutes of new rural development at agricultural universities in China as its sample, the study uses grounded theory to model the mechanism by which policies and policy changes influence the performance of university-based agricultural extension with a view to providing a new theoretical perspective and paradigm for research on university-based agricultural extension policies. Findings: The study reveals a self-reinforcement mechanism in the changes in university-based agricultural extension policies, and shows that path dependence has a normative effect on policy changes. Practical implications: University-based agricultural extension is of great significance to promoting reform and innovation in China’s agricultural extension system, which features ‘one core with multiple supplements’. Theoretical implications: The study reveals the influence of a more complex policy network composed of three levels of policy–state, provincial, local–on university-based agricultural extension, and expands the application of the policy network theory. Originality/value: The findings will guide the Chinese government in achieving its vision of creating the perfect mechanism for university-based agricultural extension. © 2020 Wageningen University.

ABSTRACT: Environmental sustainability remains an important challenge worldwide, and multiple studies highlight the need to increase individuals’ knowledge of such issues. A number of researchers suggest that universities are in a unique position to increase awareness of environmental sustainability issues and effect change in young adults and surrounding communities. This paper chronicles one interdisciplinary team’s attempt to increase sustainability awareness in a university setting within the United Arab Emirates. The research team collaborated over an 18-month period to plan and execute a series of strategic events aimed at increasing sustainability awareness among students, staff, and other university stakeholders. Having adapted a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach, the researchers collected largely qualitative data from periodic meetings, survey results, observation, and reflection activities to evaluate the success of each event. The collected data was subsequently used to plan each succeeding strategy and increase the likelihood of its success. The PAR process encouraged team reflection and facilitated collective action throughout the campaign. As a result, the team observed heightened levels of participation as the sustainability campaigned progressed. There was also a marked improvement in the attitudes of stakeholders towards the protection of the environment and sustainability practices. The study concludes with lessons learned and recommendations for best practices to manage environmental sustainability awareness campaigns. Recommendations include the employment of collaborative partnerships, effective marketing, and motivational practices. Such findings may be of practical value to Higher Education Institutions and other organizations seeking to promote sustainability awareness and create a structured awareness campaign. © 2022 WITPress.

VIEWS FROM KEY UNIVERSITY STAKEHOLDERS ON RISK STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION AND DISCLOSURE: A CASE STUDY OF SOUTH AFRICAN UNIVERSITIES
(2021) Academy of Accounting and Financial Studies Journal, 25 (6), pp. 1 - 12, Cited 1 times.
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112259906&partnerID=40&md5=9949f9e61ce162ce97aaa04f03bfead6

ABSTRACT: The implementation and disclosure of risk are still under-researched, universities in particular. The audit Committee as an oversight structure is important in the management of risk strategies in universities. Avoiding risk in an institution is everyone' responsibility, as well as the adoption of an inclusive approach in achieving institutional objectives. The aim of this article is to examine risk strategy, implementation and reporting based on views of key university stakeholders. The study follows a survey research design to analyse responses from key university stakeholders. In addition, descriptive statistics are used to establish statistical central tendency and variability amongst the risk strategy principles. Five risk strategy and objective setting principles were examined base on frequencies and mean scores. The results suggest university stakeholders strongly agree on both implementation and disclosure of four risk strategy principles. One principle agrees on implementation and disclosure is at the discretion of the university. The mean scores are in the positive zone between "agree" and "strongly agree" of the Likert scale on all of the five risk strategy principles. This article view risk strategy as indispensable for universities and the risk strategy implementation and disclosure can create and sustain value for the universities. The findings of this research can assist accounting or risk practitioners and assurance service providers to improve on risk strategy implementation and disclosure for universities. Also, the article contributes to the under-researched risk strategy body of knowledge. This article further notes the limitation to generalize findings due to the size of the sample. © 2021.

ABSTRACT: Higher education stakeholders have re-strategized to identify the unique competitive causes of comfortability among students’ satisfaction. Student satisfaction has been largely observed in the literature as a significant strategy and competitive factor for higher education providers. This has compelled institutions to implement quality measures to attract and retain both potential and current students. Therefore, this research is to explore the determinants of student satisfaction. Cross-sectional data was generated from a purposive sample of 400 students across higher education institutions in Ghana. The data was analysed using multiple regression. Expectation theory is the theory that unpins this study. The results reveal that administrative services, academic services, and physical evidence are significant components of service quality. The outcomes of the study show there is a positive and significant relationship between satisfaction, academic services, and administrative services; physical evidence influence student satisfaction. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This paper explores the nexus between University-Industry Collaborations (UIC) in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region informed by a multiple-country-case study design. This study aims to explore the motives, opportunities and challenges, and propose effective practices in the MENA region context. Based on qualitative data retrieved through a series of 72 semi-structured interviews with university stakeholders (i.e., faculty, directors of corporate training, administrative staff, gatekeepers, company representatives and liaisons) conducted from March 2021 to September 2022. The sample was determined by a criterion sampling approach that enabled the development of cases from five countries in the MENA region (United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco) with each country sample comprising five university cases on average. This study was designed on a Multiple Case Study Research Design Approach (Yin, 2013) and this was supplemented by Template Analysis (a form of thematic analysis), and to incorporate the cross-national comparative dimension, Yasin and Hafeez (2022) approaches were adopted. The findings illustrate a wide range of motives, challenges, opportunities, and effective factors that are linked to varying objectives such as (1) the vision and ownership structures, (2) the stakeholder connections of universities (3) the brand reputation of the university provider (4) the perception and ranking of universities as well as (5) approaches undertaken by the University representative to negotiate the expectations of live projects. As a result, a contextualized framework is proposed in this study as the “five [essential] keys” for successful collaborations for the nexus between university and industry collaborations. The originality of this study is inherent in the qualitative cases and contextualized influences in non-westernized countries that are empirically under-explored, as well as the five keys framework that is useful from a theoretical and practical standpoint for academics, policymakers, and university leadership. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Aim: Our research concentrates on the sustainable development and digital transformation of educational systems. This topic has gained the special attention of researchers and policymakers in recent years due to the wide spread of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the digital surge that can be observed all around the world. This digital surge, which can also be called a digital revolution, was further deepened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the massive closure of schools and universities and the deployment of online and home learning. Methods: We use data obtained from researchers and lecturers at universities and higher education institutions in the Czech Republic and Russia between September 2020 and March 2021 to perform ordinal regression analysis. This allows us to test the relationships between effectiveness as a key factor of creativity on one side and motivation to look for new ways of teaching and research during and after the COVID-19 pandemic on the other. Results: Overall, it appears that there are still many obstacles to the digital transformation of educational systems that might be embedded in the structure and the scope of today's educational institutions. We demonstrate that, at present, universities and higher educational institutions are undergoing ràdical change driven by the need to digitize education and training processes in record time, and that many academics lack the innate technical skills for online education. Nevertheless, it appears that young and motivated academics and researchers are keen on embracing new technologies and support the digital transformation of educational systems. Conclusions: Our results might be useful for decision-makers and stakeholders in universities and higher education institutions for designing their strategies for the digitalization of educational systems. © 2022 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

ABSTRACT: Tutors should be able to comprehend and build learning models that incorporate all multiple intelligences and incorporate integrated learning in order for all students' learning to be relevant and simple to comprehend. This study aims to determine: (1) a description of the profile and abilities of multiple intelligences of basic education tutors at UPBJJ UT Pekanbaru; and (2) differences in multiple intelligences based on gender, occupation, number of institutions, age, years of service, and ethnicity. This study uses a quantitative approach through a survey method, with a sample of 193 taken through a random sampling technique. All data were collected via online questionnaires and quantitatively analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23 application and the Two-Way Anova test. The results showed that: (1) the aspect of multiple intelligences, research subjects regularly have good multiple intelligences (min = 6.7); (2) there is no difference in multiple intelligences based on gender, occupation, number of institutions, age, tenure, and ethnicity; and (3) there is a relationship between physical/kinesthetic, existential/spiritual, interpersonal, intrapersonal, logical/mathematical, musical/rhythmic, naturalistic, verbal/linguistic, and visual/spatial. The university's stakeholders will next provide relevant input and action to improve the tutors' resources and skills. © 2022, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

ABSTRACT: University-industry collaboration is an interdisciplinary and multifaceted approach that aims to build a knowledge stock and improve through interaction by promoting information and technology exchange between higher education systems and the industry. University and industry have different motivations specific to their own interests. For instance, accessing to funding and empirical data from sector, development of research and teaching operations, and reputation enhancement are main motivations for universities, whereas accessing the scientific and technological knowledge, tapping to qualified personnel, gaining access to equipment and facilities of university, gaining benefit to public funding, decreasing R & D costs, and providing knowledge sharing with present personnel are the typical motivations of industry. In this chapter, the role of stakeholders in university-industry collaboration and their interactions were explained. As both partners have different aims and motivations, the potential benefits and challenges for both partners were mentioned. Then, the crucial points to take into consideration for successful collaboration were emphasized, and the importance of technology transfer offices (TTOs) on this collaboration was more detailed. In the light of this information, recommendations for future interactions were presented. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

ABSTRACT: Various forms of proofreading of student writing take place in university contexts. Sometimes writers pay freelance proofreaders to edit their texts before submission for assessment; sometimes more informal arrangements take place, where friends, family, or coursemates proofread. Such arrangements raise ethical questions for universities formulating proofreading policies: in the interests of fairness, should proofreading be debarred entirely or should it be permitted in some form? Using questionnaires and semistructured interviews, this article investigates where three university stakeholder groups stand on the ethics of proofreading. Content lecturers, English language tutors, and students shared their views on the ethics of various lighter-touch and heavier-touch proofreader interventions. All three parties broadly approved of more minor interventions, such as correcting punctuation, amending word grammar, and improving sentence structure. However, students were found to be more relaxed than lecturers and language tutors about the ethics of more substantial interventions at the level of content. There were outliers within each of the three groups whose views on proofreading were wide apart, underscoring the difficulty of formulating proofreading policies that would attract consensus across the academy. The article concludes by discussing the formulation and dissemination of appropriate, research-led proofreading guidelines and issues for further exploration. © 2023 SAGE Publications.

ABSTRACT: This study explicates discourse surrounding organizational identity negotiation among different stakeholders during organizational change in a polytechnic university. We bridge organizational identity approach and Cultural Discourse Analysis (CuDA) and demonstrate how an organizational identity is negotiated through cultural communicative practices active among student leaders, faculty, administrators, and staff. Five themes emerged from our analysis of 24 interviews with university stakeholders: 1) polytechnic as “STEM”; 2) polytechnic prioritizes certain disciplines over others; 3) polytechnic as “learn-by-doing”; 4) polytechnic as many arts; and 5) polytechnic as symbolic of tension among colleges. © 2022 Western States Communication Association.

ABSTRACT: This article explores the rationale behind the ineffectiveness of on-campus Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) activities in three Vietnamese universities. An exploratory sequential mixed-methods approach that included six in-depth interviews with lecturers and 461 responses to a student survey was employed to investigate challenges facing lecturers in implementing on-campus WIL activities and student perspectives on on-campus WIL practices. Findings revealed six obstacles associated with university stakeholders facing lecturers when organising and implementing on-campus WIL activities. Survey responses underscored student preferences in experiential and project-based learning and highlighted the importance of industry engagement to on-campus WIL effectiveness. This article calls for more awareness among university department leaders, lecturers and students about the values of on-campus WIL and suggests that further work in the areas of relevant policy and practice is required for university initiatives relating to on-campus WIL to happen. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: As the number of adjunct faculty teaching online courses remotely for their institutions continues to increase, so do the unique challenges they face, including issues of distance and isolation as well as problems pertaining to motivation, time, and compensation. Not only are these higher education faculty geographically isolated from each other and their colleagues at flagship campuses, but they also lack adequate institutional support and resources necessary to perform their roles. As institutions continue to rely heavily on this group of under-supported and undertrained instructors who teach the majority of online courses offered across the country, institutions need models and strategies to tap the expertise and perspectives of this group not only to improve teaching and learning in online programs but also to retain this critical talent pool. More consideration is needed to create institutional affinity and organizational commitment, build community, and create opportunities for remote adjunct faculty to be included as an integral component to their academic departments. The Handbook of Research on Inclusive Development for Remote Adjunct Faculty in Higher Education is a comprehensive reference work that presents research, theoretical frameworks, instructor perspectives, and program models that highlight effective strategies, innovative approaches, and unique considerations for creating professional development opportunities for remote adjunct faculty teaching online. This book provides concrete practices that foster inclusivity among contingent faculty teaching online as well as tangible practices that have been successfully implemented from faculty developers and academic leaders at institutions who have a large population of, and heavy reliance on, remote adjunct instructors. While addressing topics that include faculty engagement, mentoring programs, and instructor resources, this book intends to support remote instructors in the post-pandemic world. It is also beneficial for faculty development professionals; academic administrative leaders; higher education stakeholders; and higher education faculty, researchers, and students. © 2021 by IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of the study was to identify how stakeholders of higher education can influence the quality of the educational process and students’ readiness to embark on a career. The study used qualitative and quantitative methods sequentially with the quantitative method predominating. It relied on a survey research design and quasi-experiment with some features of a descriptive case study such as conducting observations by the external stakeholders and administering measurements. The study addressed the issues related to curriculum governance, instruction, learning assessment, and teaching resources. It also eliminated the loopholes in lecturers’ attempts to foster the students’ readiness to build a career. It enabled an objective and unbiased evaluation of the overall students’ professional efficacy during the students’ job internships. The baseline survey showed that the students and lecturers reported that they experienced limited satisfaction with the programmes. The self-branding project influenced the students’ academic efficiency and career development skills positively. The mean value for the effect size d was 0.67, indicating that it was large and statistically significant. The observation report provided by representatives of the host organizations implied that the representatives of the host companies were generally pleased with the quality of the occupational readiness of the students. The study will benefit the researchers and practitioners in terms of building long-term relationships and sharing responsibility for the quality of professional training of the students. © 2021 The authors and IJLTER.ORG.

ABSTRACT: The positive impact associated with the implementation of process solutions in private-sector organizations has been signaled in the literature on the subject. From the cognitive perspective, assessment of the vulnerability of BPM and BPM Governance implementation in public sector organizations, with particular emphasis on public universities, is of significance. The research gap, meaning the small number of publications presenting implementation of BPM Governance elements in these organizations, needs to be underlined here. The article’s originality lies in the focus on describing the empirical experience associated with strategy reconfiguration and resulting from the implementation of characteristic process organization solutions at a higher education institution. The main aim of this paper is to present the factors supporting and hindering implementation of BPM Governance at a public university. As a result of the research carried out using the methods of systematic literature review and participant observation, a catalog of the factors supporting and rigidifying the implementation of BPM Governance elements was developed. The article additionally describes the Authors’ experience in identifying the university stakeholders, the processes architecture, and the formalization of selected processes using authorial IT tools. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Ideally, comprehensible second language (L2) speech would be seen as acceptable speech. However, the association between these dimensions is underexplored. To investigate the relationship between comprehensibility and academic acceptability, defined here as how well a speaker could meet the demands of a given role in an academic setting, 204 university stakeholders judged L2 speech samples elicited from a standardized English test used for university admissions. Four tasks from 100 speakers were coded for 13 speech stream characteristics. Judgments for comprehensibility and acceptability correlated strongly (r =.93). Linear mixed-effects models, used to examine judgments across all tasks and separately for each task, indicated that while random intercepts (i.e., speaker ability, listener severity) explained a substantial amount of total variation (32-44%) in listener judgments compared to speech characteristic fixed effects (8-21%), fixed effects did account for variation in speaker random effects (reducing variation compared to intercept-only models by 50-90%). Despite some minimal differences across task types, the influence of speech characteristics across both judgments was mostly similar. While providing evidence that comprehensible speech can indeed be perceived as acceptable, this study also provides evidence that speakers demonstrate both consistent and less consistent performance, in reference to speech stream production, across performances. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Providing appropriate resources to ensure university students’ mental health and well-being is critical for their future role in the workforce, especially when faced with a disruptive crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative research was designed with twofold purposes in the context of Thai higher education. Firstly, to explore the impacts on university graduates’ psychosocial well-being and the support universities provided during the pandemic. Secondly, to examine gaps and develop recommendations for higher educational institutes to support students’ mental health and well-being regularly and in times of crisis. Data was collected through in-depth interviews with 23 participants, giving voice to key stakeholders: graduate students (n = 10), faculty members (n = 9), and working professionals (n = 4). Using inductive analysis, data was analyzed into two main categories and six themes. The first category reflected three themes: psychosocial challenges of students, impacts on mental health, and the support provided by universities. Themes in the second category described multi-level approaches for supporting university students. These findings substantiate the linkages between mental health support and developing a resilient workforce for the future and suggest pathways for strengthening these by collaborative participation of stakeholders in higher education. © 2023, Journal of Population and Social Studies.

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162217410&partnerID=40&md5=dc9b6a671ed8d93652565a5dcae9ce8a

ABSTRACT: This study investigates unproctored assignment-based assessment implementation in an online teaching environment compared to on-site assessment. A mixed-method research approach was conducted with the participation of 284 English-major students, 6 teachers, and 4 experts at a university in Vietnam. Data collection instruments included a questionnaire, in-depth questions, observations, and interviews to examine stakeholders’ evaluation of unproctored assignment-based online assessment compared with on-site assessment; differences in students’ learning motivation; drawbacks in online assessment implementation; and how to facilitate students implementing online assessment effectively. The quantitative results show that despite the significance of unproctored assignment-based assessment, students gave higher evaluations for traditional assessment, particularly in terms of measuring knowledge, examining skills, and ensuring academic integrity. Online assessment has no different impact on student learning motivation compared to traditional assessment. The qualitative data indicate that various problems in unproctored final exams challenged the effectiveness of assessment practices, such as poor adaptability to the learning objectives; more risks in submission; risks to academic integrity without proctoring, such as cheating, plagiarism, collusion, fabrication, and subjective evaluation; and limited development of skills and practice. Implications for online teaching and assessment are recommended. © 2023, Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc.. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The need for strategic planning of the internationalization process in universities is inevitable. The key stakeholders in higher education institutions (HEIs) are expected to be involved in the strategy-making process. It is argued that international office professionals (IPs) are one of these key stakeholders and need to be part of strategy development. The study aims to explore IPs’ conceptualization of internationalization, their needs, and roles in the universities, as well as their perceptions of strategic planning, management, and institutionalization of internationalization in European and Turkish universities. In this qualitative research, 23 semi-structured interviews with IPs showed that they are not sufficiently involved in the strategy-making process and could not contribute to this with their expertise as expected. This non-involvement observed in both settings has led them to imitate quantitative global strategies similar to that of universities, like increasing the number of international students. Moreover, the comparative analysis showed that European universities utilize more democratic and participatory decision-making than Turkish universities, which have little or no participation of IPs in decision-making in internationalization. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to EAIR - The European Higher Education Society.

ABSTRACT: The extrapolation of test scores to a target domain—that is, association between test performances and relevant real-world outcomes—is critical to valid score interpretation and use. This study examined the relationship between Duolingo English Test (DET) speaking scores and university stakeholders’ evaluation of DET speaking performances. A total of 190 university stakeholders (45 faculty members, 39 administrative staff, 53 graduate students, 53 undergraduate students) evaluated the comprehensibility (ease of understanding) and academic acceptability of 100 DET test-takers’ speaking performances. Academic acceptability was judged based on speakers’ suitability for communicative roles in the university context including undergraduate study, group work in courses, graduate study, and teaching. Analyses indicated a large correlation between aggregate measures of comprehensibility and acceptability (r =.98). Acceptability ratings varied according to role: acceptability for teaching was held to a notably higher standard than acceptability for undergraduate study. Stakeholder groups also differed in their ratings, with faculty tending to be more lenient in their ratings of comprehensibility and acceptability than undergraduate students and staff. Finally, both comprehensibility and acceptability measures correlated strongly with speakers’ official DET scores and subscores (r ⩾.74–.89), providing some support for the extrapolation of DET scores to academic contexts. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Research of the main university stakeholders has only been of a cross-sectional or short-term nature thereby limiting our understanding of how universities have evolved as a result of stakeholder influence. Indeed, neglect of stakeholders in strategic planning may result in both companies and universities becoming less successful and less competitive. For this reason, a temporal perspective was adopted to enable a consideration of events, their antecedents and subsequent effects thereby identifying emerging evolutionary trends and responding to them so that there can be appropriate decision making and accountability. This paper uses historical organisational studies to provide a longitudinal overview of internal and external stakeholder influence on university evolution and change from their foundations in the early Medieval period. Five university generations are described: Medieval, Humboldtian, Civic/Land Grant, Mass, and Stakeholder. This investigation reveals a number of strategic shifts in stakeholders as their voices have become increasingly prominent or have declined. Over time, the number of stakeholders have grown as their salience has been acknowledged through concepts such as the third mission; corporate social responsibility and helix structure; and, although some of the main stakeholders have remained constant such as learners and faculty, their influence has fluctuated. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: Many stakeholders in higher education develop with time. In this paper, we propose a new type of platform, called a Teaching Content Management System (TCMS). Such platforms are intended for instructors to help them produce teaching specifications and quality teaching designs. We first of all present drivers of change that currently affect universities and we discuss some specific aspects of education in higher education. We then derive a set of support requirements for instructors and provide a services design that TCMS should comply with.

ABSTRACT: In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a swift and dramatic shift in how higher education teaching, learning, and other operations occurred. In the months that followed, higher education stakeholders endured major transitions and unexpected challenges. Higher education leaders, policymakers, students, faculty, and staff were influenced by the pandemic in a variety of ways. There is much to be learned from the experiences of higher education stakeholders during the early months of the pandemic. This article introduces the two-part special issue on Higher Education Stakeholders’ Early Responses to the COVID-19 Crisis, situating the research presented in the special issue within the broader context of high-stakes decision-making during a period of global uncertainty, stress, and conflict. The first part of the special issue presents research on the responses of institutional leaders and policymakers to the COVID-19 crisis. The second part of the special issue examines student and “classroom” experiences during the early months of the pandemic. Studies such as these on the responses of higher education stakeholders to the COVID-19 crisis enhance important understanding about how institutional leaders, policymakers, and other stakeholders made sense of and took steps to address the challenges presented by the pandemic. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

ABSTRACT: The Internet is one technology that has impacted tremendously on the sociological fabric of man. In the field of education, it serves as a library of knowledge from where virtually all information could be obtained. Knowledge of how well higher institution students use the Internet for learning may enable their lecturers take appropriate decisions on their instructional practices. In this study, data was obtained from four 435 purposively selected students in the Faculties of Science of six higher institutions in Osun State, Nigeria using a researcher-designed questionnaire. The results show that 63.8% of the students indicated they used the Internet for learning. It was found out that there was no significant difference between male and female students' use of the Internet for learning and there was no significant difference in the students' use of Internet for learning in the private and public higher institutions in the State. However, there was significant difference among the students in their use of the Internet for learning with the University students showing the highest degree of positive response of use followed by the students of the College of Education and then the students of the Polytechnics. It is recommended among others that stakeholders in higher education in Osun State should endeavour to provide modern ICT/Internet facilities in all the higher institutions in Osun State so as to enable students have unlimited Internet access.

ABSTRACT: Even after the two decades of the Internet’s emergence, the higher education sector has not fully capitalized on the online platform’s efficiency. Online education has remained a small proportion of the overall course/degree program offerings at most universities. While the online platform enables cost and time efficiencies due to its inherent spatial and temporal flexibilities, it also creates efficacy challenges in meeting diverse learning and pedagogical needs. Before the coronavirus pandemic, online education was predominantly deployed in an asynchronous mode, resulting in a lack of effective student engagement, personalized learning, integrity issues, and market acceptance. The Covid-19 pandemic has compelled the widespread adoption of synchronous online education that can remove efficacy barriers of asynchronous online mode. Based on the efficiency and efficacy tradeoffs, a conceptual framework for classifying various higher education delivery modes is presented in this article. The framework can help higher education stakeholders choose the most appropriate delivery mode based on their diverse needs. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: This triangulation mixed methods study employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to investigate the factors affecting continuance intention toward Coursera MOOCs blended learning (CMBL) with undergraduate students at a Vietnamese private higher education institution (HEI). IBM AMOS version 24 was employed, with which Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were used to examine the reliability and validity of the data collected from 637 students. Manual coding and thematic analysis of qualitative data collected from 30 interviewees, namely administrators, lecturers, curriculum developers, and students, were also conducted to identify the emerged themes and sub-themes. Content feature, social influence, and perceived usefulness were critical factors influencing the HEI students’ continuance intention to use CMBL. This study makes two significant contributions. First, we contribute to the literature from a theoretical standpoint by comparing factors influencing students’ acceptance of CMBL from critical stakeholders in a higher education institution. Second, our findings have practical implications on increasing undergraduate students’ acceptance of blended learning using MOOCs for the long term, which could provide beneficial pointers for HEIs planning to integrate MOOCs for teaching and learning within the higher education context. © The Author(s) 2023.

ABSTRACT: The emergence of the “entrepreneurial university model” (EUM), which supports university-based commercialization and entrepreneurship, is almost universally praised. In this study, we take a contrarian view, arguing that the existing EUM does not adequately account for the true costs borne by participating stakeholders. We advance three alternative pathways that take a systems view to address the limitations of the current EUM. Considering alternative pathways is critical because the EUM as currently constructed is not sustainable. These pathways provide possible ways forward with more desirable outcomes for the myriad of university stakeholders, not just the elite universities and their star scientists. Specifically, each proposed pathway considers the inputs, processes, and outcomes for each pertinent stakeholder group. Our research imparts important policy implications for institutions tasked with commercializing scientific discoveries and policy-makers challenged with developing high growth, sustainable models.

ABSTRACT: The sustainable development of female university teachers in China faces a range of societal and workplace challenges, especially since the advent of China’s ‘Universal Three-Child Policy’. We applied ‘ecofeminism’ and ‘intersectionality’ perspectives to investigate the role of conflict and endogenous/exogenous environmental culture pressure on the sustainable development of female teachers in world-class Chinese universities. Semi-structured qualitative interviews took place with 28 female teachers in 6 Chinese universities and colleges. The findings indicated that individuals experience deep role conflicts and stereotypes of traditional society. The inherent thinking and behavior patterns brought about through the socialization of female teachers make it difficult for them to achieve self-identity in their professional development. Female teachers should strengthen their subjective consciousness rather than be consumed by multiple identities and role conflicts. Universities and colleges have a duty to protect women’s reproductive rights and prevent gender discrimination linked to these rights. Cultural identification should be promoted and embedded culturally-based gender bias must be avoided to promote gender equality and a change in customs. © 2023 by the authors.

ABSTRACT: The presence and influence of university-based sales centers are growing at a substantial rate, with 61 universities having membership in the University Sales Center Alliance (USCA) as of 2021, up from 52 in 2020 and 8 in 2002. While the function and appeal of having an interface exist between sales students, sales faculty, and sales center partners are apparent, the value created by sales centers for these diverse stakeholders remains underexplored. The present research explores the value derived by these stakeholder groups by conducting and analyzing 41 depth interviews of students, university faculty and administration, and members of partnering firms who are currently involved with university-based sales centers. A 3 × 2 matrix of the perceived value derived from sales centers, consisting of other vs. self-oriented, intrinsic vs. extrinsic, and active vs. passive, is presented across these stakeholder groups. The results suggest that value stemming from university-based sales centers often differs between stakeholders, suggesting that sales center administrators should not assume that value derived from sales centers is static or universal across the stakeholder groups. © 2022 Korean Scholars of Marketing Science.

ABSTRACT: The purpose of the study is to explore the ways of involving university stakeholders specifically in updating educational services. It combined exploratory and observational research methods which relied on qualitative or quantitative data gathered through the researcher-designed and validated tools which were the empirical and methodological contributions to the previous research. The five most frequent choices that might encourage the stakeholders to donate or invest in an educational institution were as follows: a portfolio of the use of donations, investments, or grants, having a stake in the educational services of more than 7%, having access to budgeting and cost reporting, having a share in the institutions’ profit and being one of the decision-makers. The factors that discouraged investors from investing in education were as follows: distrust of the activity of the educational institutions in terms of addressing the stakeholders’ needs or interests, lack of engagement or cooperation, institutional and government-imposed barriers between them and the institutions, uncertainty concerning the efficiency of the institutions and inefficient use of the resources by the institutions. The initiative was complimentarily perceived by stakeholders in terms of collaboration and investment opportunities. It was also found beneficial by the sampled students. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: The ability to predict students' performance is important not only for the students but also for academic stakeholders in higher education institutes. Predictions can be made by using data stored in an academic information system on students' behavior related to taking courses that are an important part of a higher education institute with a coherent vertical curriculum. A student's course-taking behavior can be used as an indicator of their potential performance by investigating the alignment of their course-taking activities with curriculum guidelines. Domain knowledge is also considered as a variable due to the varying compositions of courses in curriculum guidelines. Past performance also needs to be taken into consideration. The result of the prediction can be used to help academic stakeholders take actions such as intervening to ensuring that students graduate on time. In this paper, we propose a two-layer ensemble learning technique that combines ensemble learning and ensemble-based progressive prediction and it utilizes students' learning behavior data and domain knowledge for current and past performances. The results show that the accuracy of our proposed framework on a real-world student dataset is improved. © 2023 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Introduction. Communication complexities which often occur in interdisciplinary work gave rise to the studies on teaching interdisciplinary communication. A growing need to provide pedagogical solutions to facilitate teaching interdisciplinary communication stimulated the research into language as a social practice to better understand communication process for interdisciplinary purposes. Aim. This exploratory study investigates the concept of interdisciplinary communicative competence and proposes a framework of interdisciplinary communicative competence with the focus on three underlying components: knowledge, skills, and personal attributes of interdisciplinary team members. Methodology and research methods. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used. The data obtained from 24 in-depth semi-structured interviews with five groups of higher education stakeholders (employers, academic directors of the programmes, professors, students, and alumni) revealed the existing interdisciplinary practices in the university and cross-functional practices in the companies. The proposed framework was empirically tested using an online survey with 139 responses from professors, students, and employers. The data processing techniques included the use of Kendall’s concordance coefficient, Cronbach’s alpha, and the principal component analysis. Results. The study presents the authors’ conceptualisation of interdisciplinary communicative competence and its framework as the result of the literature analysis and the empirical research. The findings provided evidence on the importance of language skills for effective interdisciplinary communication as perceived by 5 groups of respondents. The choice of language skills as a basic component of interdisciplinary communicative competence is justified. Scientific novelty. The study contributes to the conceptualisation of a framework of interdisciplinary communicative competence. The elements of the framework are identified and their relevance is empirically tested. Practical significance. The results of the empirical part of the study can be applied in the design of interdisciplinary learning process in higher education, for example, in the design of interdisciplinary courses, and teaching materials. © 2023 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

ABSTRACT: This chapter contributes to the topical area of higher education marketing by exploring how branding adds value to universities. The primary focus of exploring branding concepts associated with successful higher education brands in a UK context was chosen for this work with a view to later comparison with other countries such as the United States, where branding of universities has a longer practical and academic history. The concept of "successful" brands was explored through the extant literature, and the subsequent research identified constructs underpinning a successful university brand. These constructs were then tested among a larger sample of UK university stakeholders. The findings explored the variables associated with successful university brands and suggested significant relationships among these variables. A further stage involved qualitative exploration of current perceptions and practices in HE branding, designed to maintain currency and build ongoing research possibilities. Overall, the chapter offers suggestions for both academia and practice on what underpins a successful university brand, and the variables associated with these brands. © 2017, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: This chapter engages the formation of an interdisciplinary peer-mentoring group that empowered graduate students of color to navigate varied and complex challenges within a predominantly white institution (PWI) in the Rocky Mountain Region. In doing this work, both intended and unintended barriers were exposed and navigated. The chapter describes the journeys of three students and their advisor, who are from diverse backgrounds. Their journeys are followed from the formation of the group through their matriculation and subsequent steps in their respective professional careers. The auto-ethnographic techniques, derived from self-study, involved an application of those utilized by CURVE-Y-FRiENDs (C-Y-F) global network. The challenges identified based on C-Y-F were: (1) intellectual identities, (2) cultural/racial/ethnic/linguistic identities, (3) pursuit of professional careers, and (4) personal/professional relationships. In our work, we identify our journeys’ salient outcomes and provide practical recommendations for various university stakeholders. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

ABSTRACT: Student–faculty interactions that promote learning are essential contributors to student retention, academic success and satisfaction. But the factors that causally initiate and frame these interactions are not well understood. Only if students evaluate these interactions as positive will they seek them. We conducted a survey experiment with students (n = 375) from a tuition-fee-free German business school, using conditional process analysis to assess which factors frame effective interactions. We focus on out-of-classroom standard and non-standard requests that students make to faculty, then investigate how faculty and student gender and students’ academic entitlement influence the interaction. Our study examines how students evaluate the interaction with faculty: when they seek interaction, their expectations of getting their requests approved, and their disappointment when their requests are declined. We find a significant influence of the request type along with moderating effects of faculty gender, student gender and student entitlement, particularly for non-standard work requests. We conclude with policy implications for university management: developing target-group-specific measures that facilitate the desired and positively evaluated student–faculty interactions might benefit all university stakeholders. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: For a better understanding of the impact of global student flows on industries and knowledge societies, we need to rethink the relationship between global student mobility and migrant knowledge. The authors elaborate on the view that current policy and practice relating to higher education mobility puts too much emphasis on mobilizing pools of knowledge, thereby ignoring the fact that knowledge flows tend to be concentrated among people who are actively participating in the knowledge flow. Adopting a shared social context perspective on the dynamics of knowledge flow embedded in mobile minds may enable a better assessment to be made of the impact of student mobility over time on industries and societies. Given such an assessment, policy and practice measures can be developed to encourage those involved in the knowledge flow to exploit student talent flow more effectively. © 2014, © 2014 SAGE Publications.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, Tiffany J. Davis and Yolanda Barnes explore the question, “Who has a stake in college students?" They begin by offering a brief background of stakeholder theory for context and then identify specific stakeholders, delineating their connection to higher education broadly and interest in college students specifically. We then offer a taxonomy of higher education stakeholders that describes the different ways that stakeholder type influences the way they view college students. Finally, they conclude the chapter by articulating the changing role of stakeholders, including how colleges and universities are prioritizing stakeholder needs and interests. © 2023 Taylor and Francis.

ABSTRACT: Being a first-year student living with disability can be challenging. However, many of these challenges hold potential towards growth and wellbeing. This study explored and described the challenge-related growth experiences of first-year students living with a disability at a higher education institution in South Africa. Individual interviews and reflective writing exercises were conducted with 20 students living with a variety of disabilities. Data gathered were thematically analysed through an intentional process of data reduction. Prominent spheres of challenge included (a) the higher education environment, (2) social integration and inclusion and (3) academics; with unique challenges related to specific disabilities. An important theme that emerged, is the participants’ positive use of these challenges as growth opportunities. The findings allude to the pathways to growth associated with the difficulties of being a first-year student living with a disability, namely greater self-acceptance, more purposeful action, and existential meaning. These findings have value as university stakeholders aim towards greater student wellbeing and inclusion, especially for students living with disabilities. © 2022 University of the Free State.

ABSTRACT: The last electoral process to appoint academic authorities for the 2010-2014 period at the University of Cartagena, Colombia, is analyzed because of its nature as both a public and nonprofit organization. Data from the official voting records reported by the institution is used to address the research objectives. The paper establishes a Marketing Map approach to show how much the votes of each one (obtained, from a candidate's perspective; given, from an electorate's perspective) counts when a standardized comparative base is adopted given a particular institutional arrangement. Therefore, the approach appeals the interest of the actual winners (and likely future candidates to another chair, or the same as reelected), future new candidates, university's stakeholders, and scholars interested in democratic processes. The paper contributes with designing an institutional electoral benchmarking tool, technically simple to elaborate, and easy to read and to understand in practice. Also, the created tool provides useful insights to organizations or institutions with similar features. As underlying contribution, the paper honors the public nature of information in public organizations when available for rigorous analyses taking an outside point of view and contributes in its own way to increasing the available literature about democratic processes. Conclusions, future research avenues and practical implications both in political and marketing terms are elicited from prior parts of the paper. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

ABSTRACT: This paper aims at measuring the mediating effect of psychological wellbeing in the relationship between university students' self-esteem and their academic achievement, as well as examining the direct and indirect effect of peer-support to academic achievement through psychological wellbeing. For these purposes, a quantitative research with specific reference to empirical survey was conducted with the active participation of 204 university students. Results of structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis indicate that there was a positive and significant mediating effect of psychological wellbeing in the relationship between self-esteem and students' academic achievement. However, the direct effect of students' peer-support to their academic achievement was greater compared to its indirect effect through students' psychological wellbeing. This concludes that both psychological wellbeing and peer-support play significant roles in supporting the academic achievements of students. This study implies the significance of these variables to the academic achievement of students and accordingly government and university stakeholders should pay more attention in presenting these variables within the academic environment of university. © IAEME Publication

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Athletic departments play an important role in sustainability-based collaborative processes due to their boundary spanning connections with both internal and external university stakeholders. As a result, athletic department representatives have become prominent members of university participant-governed network structures. The purpose of this study is to examine the role of dedicated “athletics green teams” as a unique form of control and coordination by considering how green team interactions support and augment the collaborative network of actors who are responsible for executing athletics sustainability practices on university campuses. Design/methodology/approach: A sociocentric analysis is used to explore the network of a green team at a large American university. The analysis focuses on examining the size, composition and structure of relations involving green team members that facilitated various forms of information transmission and strategic action(s). Findings: The results highlight how the presence of the athletic department in the green team provides heterophilous and multiplex relations across the collaborative network and how the green team itself provides a unique forum for planning and coordination, which is critical for providing more sophisticated, advanced structures for sustainability. Practical implications: The findings of this study should reassure practitioners involved in convening green teams that such shared governance structures add value to athletics sustainability collaborative processes. In addition, subtle changes to the network governance structures has the potential to streamline the contribution of athletic departments to university sustainability initiatives and help project a more cohesive “Athletics” sustainability message that transmits across the collaborative network. Originality/value: The outcomes of dedicated athletics green teams have been explored from a largely qualitative perspective. However, this study applies a novel relational approach to understand the shared governance value-added within a largely intra-organizational collaborative network. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Global university rankings (GURs) have received unprecedented attention from so many higher education stakeholders, ranging from policy makers to the general public. We provide a critical overview of GURs drawing on a geopolitics of knowledge (GoK) lens. We highlight and introduce three major university rankings that have a global impact, such as ARWU, THE, and QS world university rankings. We illuminate how these three rankings perpetuate GoK in two ways: (a) universalizing languages of quality and excellence and (b) reproducing colonial knowledge/power relations. We argue that GoK is integral to articulating and challenging the global politics of knowing and being in contemporary higher education. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Initial teacher education (ITE) programs continue to receive critique regarding how they prepare preservice teachers. This comes at time when much emphasis is on effective integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) into teacher preparation. Research reveals the ubiquity of mobile technologies and their benefits about effective integration in ITE. In New Zealand, the use of mobile technologies in ITE must be considered in how they enhance educational outcomes of learners. However, little is known of how teacher educators introduce such innovative teaching techniques or the effect of mobile technologies on the teaching and learning experiences of preservice teachers. This study will examine teaching and learning practices with mobile technologies in a leading institution in ITE programs in New Zealand. The research question guiding this study is: How is the use of mobile technologies in ITE affecting the teaching and learning experiences of preservice teachers? The outcomes of such research aims to show the impact mobile learning practices have in preparing preservice teachers to meet the demands of 21st Century learning. Educators, policy makers, and university stakeholders may use the findings of this study to inform discussions concerning integration of mobile learning into the curriculum to deliver technology-enhanced learning. © 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

ABSTRACT: Universities are now facing the strengths and challenges of a multi-generational workforce that includes staff who belong to the so-called millennial generation. While millennial workers possess a breadth of talents and insights that workers from other generations may not, there can be dissonance, incivility, and even aggression directed by these staff members toward their supervisors. In universities, the problem may be exacerbated by a culture of academic freedom and freedom of speech. In addition to these freedoms is the reality that universities are deeply committed to equity and inclusion. Based on a review of the literature and extrapolating from case studies in Canadian universities, the authors propose that there is much work for all university stakeholders to do to achieve high functioning and respectful multi-generational teams. © 2018 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Successful completion of prerequisite coursework is paramount in preparing students to successfully complete of subsequent courses. However, as higher education stakeholders have placed an emphasis on roadblocks to student progression and success in college, programs of higher education may need to reassess whether prerequisites are necessary. The current study examines whether a prerequisite Spreadsheet Application course (CIS 2000) and MOS Certification exam taken by students attending a regional, public, four-year university is needed to adequately prepare students for successful completion of a Basic Business Statistics class (BUAD 2120). Utilizing three years of data, researchers conducted a correlational analysis between the students’ MOS in Excel certification scores and the final grades in CIS 2000, the students’ final grades in CIS 2000 and the final grades in BUAD 2120, and the students’ MOS in Excel certification scores and the final grades in BUAD 2120. The results of the Pearson product-moment correlation showed significant relationships with varying degrees of strengths. As correlation is not causation, further study is needed to determine the true effect of the prerequisite knowledge on success in the BUAD 2120 class. © 2021 The MITRE Corporation.

ABSTRACT: Institutions of higher education increasingly engage in internationalization efforts, for a variety of reasons. The collection of practices these institutions engage in, which can be called conventional internationalization models (CIM) largely focus on centralized and institutionalized efforts. This paper reviews typical aspects of CIM, noting their benefits while also spotlighting the costs they entail and the open spaces they leave. The paper then introduces the self-internationalization model (SIM) as a complement and a supplement to CIM. SIM offers a less centralized approach to internationalization, focusing instead on individual initiatives taken by faculty, academic managers and students. SIM offers institutions a way to continue their ongoing internationalization efforts given the anticipated educational landscape of the future, in which educational models are foreseen to be flexible, student-oriented and less costly because of the rapid increase in the supply of quality technology-based education, hybrid education, and internationalization of institutions of higher education through diverse modus operandi. This paper explains the functional aspects of SIM, and its comparative advantages and disadvantages vis-à-vis CIM. Furthermore, it provides guidelines for the design and implementation of comprehensive, innovative and dynamic internationalization models combining SIM and CIM in a manner that is suitable, convenient, affordable, and beneficial for all stakeholders in higher education institutions. © 2017 International Business Information Management Association IBIMA.

ABSTRACT: The progress of sustainability within higher education has steadily increased in focus over the last decade and has increasingly become a topic of academic research. With various scholars, journals and conferences exclusively dealing with the subject, a wealth of literature has been produced on best practices, suggestions, and assessments pertaining to sustainability within the higher education field. Higher education stakeholders, who for this paper are defined as being the potential/current students, staff and management, continue to become more conscious of the principles of sustainability. This higher level of understanding promotes the needs to assess existing literature in relation to the actual needs of the stakeholders in order to identify existing features, trends and needs so that there is continual improvement in the field. This paper shows that sustainability is currently a socially desirable trait but other factors, such as becoming more competitive in the job market, supersede it in importance to stakeholders. It also shows that there is a general need for a standardized method for assessing institutions, with AASHE's STARS system being the most used system.

ABSTRACT: The article deals with the validation of the internationalization imperative in higher education institutions (HEIs) of the Nordic countries. I focus on both the goals and motives behind activities supporting internationalization, but also on the manner of their habitualization and institutionalization in the practice of academic administration and organizational management. The issue of legitimization of institutional changes is addressed by means of the rationalized myths that create durable dispositions for specific practices, changes in procedures and attitudes in a given socio-political setting. I draw on empirical examples that include practical solutions and strategies developed under the conditions of semiperipheral positionality of the Nordic states. This perspective makes their internationalization policies an interesting frame of reference for other countries and the paper concludes by pointing to the latest trends that can serve either as an inspiration or a warning for other states. The Nordic countries offer an example of how institutionalizing the ‘strategic gains’ narrative from globalization may lead to a recalibration of an earlier knowledge regime along with attempts to change centre-periphery relations, including the reframing of priorities and rationalities of different stakeholders in higher education. © 2023 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: A varied set of major stakeholders in higher education results in diverse perspectives on what entails quality in online higher education. Learners, employers, accreditation agencies, funding and regulatory authorities, and higher education institutions exist for different purposes. Yet, all have a common interest in the success of the learners' education. Examining the faculty role in ensuring quality in online higher education, developing a working definition of that role, and identifying considerations for faculty practice that are essential to achieving that end is the purpose of this chapter. The chapter conveys and explains the results of a thematic analysis of the requirements and expectations of the major stakeholders, their contribution toward the formulation of the working definition of the faculty role, their contribution toward the identification of significant considerations for faculty in exercising their role, and makes recommendations for further investigation. © 2018 by IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: This paper examined the level of students' participation in governance of Universities. It also investigated the level of organizational effectiveness in the universities in Nigeria. The population of the study consists of all students in Federal and State Universities in Ekiti and Ondo State of Nigeria. The sample for the study was 510 subjects consisting of 400 students and 110 University administrators. The respondents were selected using stratified random sampling technique. The instruments tagged Students' Participation in University Governance Questionnaire (SPUGQ) and Organizational Effectiveness Questionnaire [OEQ] was used to elicit relevant information from the respondents. Frequency count, percentage and t-test statistics were used to analyze the data collected. The findings revealed that students' participation in University governance was low while organization effectiveness was moderate. The result showed that there was significant difference in students' participation in governance in Federal and State Universities. Students in Federal Universities participated more in the governance than students in State Universities. Finding also revealed that there was significant difference in Organizational effectiveness of Federal and State Universities. The Organization effectiveness of Federal University is higher than the State Universities. It was recommended that stakeholders in University education should ensure that students are more involved in the governance of their institutions. Also introduction of seminars and workshops on leadership training would enhance organizational effectiveness in the Universities.

ABSTRACT: Despite efforts to increase the number of students from socio-economically marginalised communities in higher education (HE) they remain under-represented, a situation likely to perpetuate economic and social inequality. University is a form of HE that is especially vulnerable to decreased representation of students from marginalised communities. This study draws on the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in HE access to identify contemporary barriers to attending university in the Republic of Ireland. It highlights the perspectives of stakeholder groups connected with a university peer mentoring access initiative, including secondary education students and their parents, HE students and graduates, and university and secondary school staff. Findings suggest that contemporary barriers to accessing universities are manifold and include socio-cultural, financial and structural factors involved in applying for, and attending, university. Stakeholders identified supports that would address these factors, with a strong emphasis on the need for relational supports provided through the peer mentoring programme to ensure students feel included in, and prepared to succeed at university. Differences in perspectives by stakeholder group were evident. Secondary education students frequently highlighted socio-cultural and structural barriers to university, for example the low expectations of themselves or others and the ‘points’ entry system. In contrast, university students and graduates emphasised the need for relational support, knowledge and preparedness in applying for and attending university. The series of barriers identified in this study begin in secondary education and continue throughout HE indicating a need for ongoing responsive supports at various stages throughout students’ educational journey. © 2022 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Under the conditions of the economy's digital transformation, electrical engineering specialties are becoming especially important. This leads to increased popularity of universities which train specialists in this sphere and at the same time intensifies the competition between them for the best applicants. The introduction of a distance-learning format amplifies this trend, expands the scope of competition between universities, and brings it from the level of cities and regions to the state, or even international, level. In this context, a university's social capital becomes very important, because one of the most critical factors in choosing an educational institution is its accumulated reputation.The article deals with the main directions of social capital formation and possibilities of its accumulation by educational institutions. Based on the example of the largest universities in Russia that provide training in electroenergetics and electrical engineering, a rating has been compiled for the accumulated publicity capital, which is one of the main indicators of the university's performance and methods of increasing social capital. The features of social capital management in the online and offline environment are considered. Particular attention is paid to the accumulation of social capital in relation to one of the most important groups of university stakeholders-students. The method of constructing psychosemantic spaces in assessing the social capital of the university has been proved effective. © 2021 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: This study examined the economic and social impact of Malaysian universities on their communities from stakeholders' perspectives. It analysed whether university stakeholders' spending, human capital (HC) and knowledge exploration (KE) will impact aggregate income (AI), quality of life (QOL) and business growth (BG) in surrounding communities. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted among 540 university stakeholders from the southern, northern and eastern regions of Malaysia, representing the alumni, community and industry. Data were subjected to factor analysis using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: Results showed that universities impacted communities' economic development and wellbeing, thereby fulfilling their community-related role. Originality/value: This study addressed universities' role in communities' economic growth and social development. Universities' contributions towards communities can be improved through the proposed model, which suggests ways to maximise their impact. A more detailed study of a particular university is needed to identify other factors that can strengthen universities' impact, even at national and global levels. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Assessing university graduates’ legal English proficiency in workability is a vital activity in legal English language teaching to meet the job requirements. This quantitative empirical study investigated 35 participants from standing legal organs operating in Vietnam, using a researcher-made questionnaire to evaluate employers’ requirements for school leavers, major in legal English for workability. There were seven dimensions relating to employers’ requirements, namely the evaluation of legal English language skills, the prevalence of legal English language skills applied, the effective level of English language skills at workplace, the proficiency of legal English language requirement, legal English proficiency meeting employees’ requirement for positions, methods of organizations evaluating the English language skills of applicants, and organization’s schemes for applicants with good English proficiency. The results reveal that the employers have high opinions on using legal English at workplace, mainly reading and speaking skills. The findings indicate that employers implement a rigorous process when recruiting new graduates with legal English proficiency and formal tertiary qualifications. In addition, employers carry out a prioritized policy for employees who demonstrate their good English proficiency during their working practices. The findings would benefit employers recruiting right employees, university stakeholders adjusting their training policies, and students preparing well before graduation to satisfy employers’ expectations and the society’s demand accordingly. © 2022 by University of Niš, Serbia.

ABSTRACT: Stakeholders' views on the ideal future university will be tackled, based on the participants of the workshop and European students' opinions expressed during BEST Symposia on Education (BSE)[1][2][3]. Three currently important questions on Engineering Education will be answered: what students want to learn, how they want to learn and where they want to learn. Topics such as curriculum development, learning methods and learning spaces will be addressed, respectively. The interactive nature of the workshop will allow participants not only to become aware of differences between stakeholders' opinions, but also to contribute on discussing the BSE outcomes. For the past 22 years, Board of European Students of Technology (BEST) has involved students in STEM education. BEST works voluntarily to bring forward the perspectives of students as a key element in educational decision making and increase the dissemination of students' input at SEFI AC 2018. The workshop contribution will enhance constructive dialogue between students, universities, and other Higher Education stakeholders. © Proceedings of the 46th SEFI Annual Conference 2018: Creativity, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for Engineering Education Excellence.

Thriving or surviving: staff health metrics and lifestyle behaviours within an Irish higher education setting
(2022) International Journal of Workplace Health Management, 15 (2), pp. 193 - 214, Cited 0 times.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Due to the international paucity of empirical evidence, this study aimed to investigate the health metrics and lifestyle behaviours of a staff cohort in a higher education institution (HEI) in Ireland. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 279 (16.4% response rate) HEI staff (academic, management, clerical/support), via a web-based health questionnaire that incorporated validated measures such as the Mental Health Index-5, Energy and Vitality Index, Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (short form) and the AUDIT-C drinking subscale. A cluster analytical procedure was used to examine the presence of distinct clusters of individuals exhibiting either optimal or sub-optimal health behaviours. Findings: A multitude of concerning patterns were identified including poor anthropometric profiles (64.4% of males overweight/obese), excessive occupational sitting time (67.8% of females sitting for = 4 h per day), hazardous drinking among younger staff (38.2% of 18–34 year olds), sub-optimal sleep duration on weeknights (82.2% less than 8 h), less favourable mean psychometric indices than the general Irish population, and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake (62.1% reporting <5 daily servings). Cluster analysis revealed “Healthy lifestyle” individuals exhibited significantly lower BMI values, lower stress levels and reported fewer days absent from work compared to those with a “Sub-optimal lifestyle”. Originality/value: In contrast to the abundance of research pertaining to student cohorts, the current study is the first to examine the clustering of health-related variables in a cohort of HEI staff in Ireland. Findings will be used to inform policy at the host institution and will be of broader interest to higher education stakeholders elsewhere. Future longitudinal studies are required to monitor the health challenges experienced by this influential, yet under-researched cohort. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: The chapter aims to investigate the impact of the presence of the university on the perceived quality of life of the host community. To this aim, the authors focused on a specific area, that is the historical town center of Naples (as defined by the UNESCO in the World Heritage List since 1995), where five universities are located. Adopting a qualitative and explorative approach, 25 in-depth interviews have been conducted with local universities’ stakeholders and content-analyzed through the software Nvivo 10. Thus, the authors identified precisely the multiplicity of activities through which the presence of the university contributes to the socio-economic and cultural well-being of the community of which it is part, thinking about the dynamics that may occur in the case of an urban-located university. Based on the findings, a conceptual model is proposed that may be further validated with new investigations. © 2022, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: Alcohol intoxication is a prevalent feature of university life and campus sexual assault cases. While previous research has examined how students perceive obvious cases of assault, less is known about how students evaluate more ambiguous sexual scenarios—such as those including two intoxicated individuals. In three survey experiments with college students (N = 990), we examined how manipulating the intoxication (sober vs. drunk) of a man accused of assault (the respondent) influenced perceptions of a hook-up scenario involving an intoxicated woman. Although university policies indicate that respondent intoxication should not influence evaluations of these scenarios, we hypothesized that students would be influenced by cues of respondent intoxication when making judgments of the hook-up and the individuals involved. Students reported that the hook-up was a sexual assault more often when the respondent was sober compared to when he was drunk, and they found sober respondents more responsible for the encounter than drunk respondents. Although effect sizes fluctuated across studies, an internal meta-analysis found evidence of significant (but modest) aggregate effects. Furthermore, perceptions of the respondent’s agency mediated the effects of intoxication on perceptions of respondent responsibility (Studies 2 & 3). We also manipulated whether the respondent should have reasonably known the complainant was drunk (Studies 1 & 2) and whether the complainant or the complainant’s friend reported the incident (Study 3), but these manipulations had little effect on students’ perceptions of the vignettes. We discuss how our findings can guide future research and consider implications of our results for university stakeholders. © 2022, The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, Mark Anthony Torrez discusses concepts related to the diversity of today’s college students. In the context of this chapter (and book), college student diversity is positioned as a central discourse, which fundamentally orients the research, theory, organization, and practice of U.S. higher education in the 21st century. Because people’s worldviews and ideologies are related to their decisions and behaviors, as we learn more about how higher education stakeholders differentially perceive diversity, we may also gain critical insight(s) into their differential motivations and modalities of engaging today’s college student population. © 2023 Taylor and Francis.

ABSTRACT: Academic misconduct seems to have increased substantially during the pandemic, with a worldwide upsurge in reported cases. The aim of this project is to construct a framework for helping students engage with issues concerning academic integrity and avoid academic misconduct. This Work-In-Progress paper reports on the construction of a scenario-based framework to investigate the beliefs and attitudes of university stakeholders when confronted with decisions about potential academic misconduct. The framework will be based on using scenarios to spur individual reflections and discussions among the students regarding values related to academic integrity focusing on Uppsala University context. A repository of "misconduct"scenarios related to different cultures, including different views and regulations, is intended to support teachers to develop modules tailored to their current need. The underlying idea is to provide students with an understanding of what constitutes academic misconduct in Uppsala University setting and to help them find honest alternatives when faced with temptations to "cheat". Our view is that students, in general, want to behave honestly, and that this framework will provide a means to help students follow their moral "compass"and avoid dishonest behaviour. © 2022 IEEE.

ABSTRACT: This chapter introduces the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak to educational systems. The pandemic exerted serious pressure on higher education systems, prompting the search for innovative solutions and triggering structural transformation. Online education had to replace face-to-face training and environments, with its opportunities and uncertainties. Web 2.0 tools promise to increase the effectiveness of online education with the opportunities it offers. The advantages offered by Web 2.0 tools should be taken into account and should be involved in the transformation process of higher education systems. Higher education institutions and their stakeholders should evaluate the experiences gained during the COVID-19 pandemic in detail, the opportunities and risks offered by technological transformation, and build the future of higher education aligned with the results. If the outputs of this process are evaluated effectively, accurate and operative inferences are made and innovative and sustainable solutions are developed. This process can carry educational systems to a brighter future. © 2022 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

ABSTRACT: The unprecedented growth of universities in recent years has meant that there are more students with learning disabilities attending courses. Consequently, universities have had to adapt, improve and create new resources to ensure greater inclusivity. These resources, their design, and development are managed by inclusion support services, aiming to the full inclusion of students with disabilities and the promotion of community awareness. This article aims to shed light on the current role of inclusion services in supporting students with learning disabilities, and the link these services have with the different university stakeholders, using a thematic analysis from the experiences of this services staff in eight Spanish universities. The results show that: i) there is no uniformity in the support services; and ii) more resources and work are needed to ensure increased inclusion and awareness. The discussion and conclusions drawn highlight the trends, challenges, and opportunities for universities improving their inclusion. © 2023 Association for Tertiary Education Management and the Melbourne Centre for the Study of Higher Education.

Avoiding the burst pipeline post-COVID-19: drivers of female academic careers in Australia
(2022) Personnel Review, Cited 0 times.

ABSTRACT: Purpose: Literature around the careers of female academics is targeted mainly toward identifying and examining career progression inhibitors, while the drivers appear largely unexplored. This paper aims to contribute to contemporary knowledge by identifying drivers to the career progression of female academics in Australia. With COVID-19 currently impacting the careers of female academics this knowledge can assist universities and human resource (HR) professionals in developing policies and practices to better facilitate female academic career progression. Design/methodology/approach: Empirically this paper draws on a qualitative study of 18 male and 29 female academics, as well as nine senior university stakeholders. The authors employed semi-structured interviews and a novel methodology, Draw, Write, Reflect. Findings: In line with attribution theory, senior stakeholders mainly identified organisational efforts, including leadership, gender equity endeavours, recruitment and promotion approaches, as well as a construct known as “relative to opportunity considerations”, as drivers of female academics’ career progression. Female academics, however, largely attributed their career progression to personal factors, such as family support, informal mentoring, and determination and persistence. Practical implications: The findings have implications for universities and HR practices seeking to facilitate female academic career progression. Implementation of the drivers identified may enhance female academics’ abilities to progress their careers. Originality/value: By focussing on the drivers of, rather than the barriers to, female academic careers, the research is novel in its identification of a previously unexplored mismatch between organisational attribution and individual attribution of career progression drivers thereby advancing knowledge of gender differences in academic careers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

ABSTRACT: Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the landscape of higher education had been primed for upheaval. The pandemic has only accentuated the need for change. Not only have we had to scramble to provide meaningful and valuable content to our students; we have also had to reinvent how that content is delivered. Beyond these changes that have abruptly affected all of us, expectations from students, colleagues, and administrators have unilaterally risen. We are expected to publish more, and in better journals. We are expected to provide more service, internally and externally. We are expected to get better teacher evaluations from students, and to deliver up-to-date content in a way that can convince students that they are benefiting from their paid education more than they would by taking online courses (often for free). The pressure to succeed on all fronts has never been higher. In this panel discussion, seasoned scholars, who have succeeded, will share insights from their experiences navigating this new landscape and reinventing their own mindset and work habits to accommodate the increasing expectations placed on faculty. Each panelist will take the position of a key stakeholder in higher education including university leaders, society, the business community, journal editors, and students. © 2020 26th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2020.

ABSTRACT: This study proposes an issue-oriented data integration and system-building model to promote institutional research. In direction of the issues, we advance the idea of grouping university stakeholders into the university, students, and the public. In the aspect of data integration and system construction, five steps are proposed: issue confirmation, information system and data inventory, data model establishment, data warehouse and data dictionary establishment, and system construction and data analysis. Finally, this study proposes several preliminary conclusions and suggestions on the promotion of institutional research for universities or researchers. © 2021 ECBIOS 2021. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: Background: The unprecedented and unchecked corruption practices that are prevalent in universities in South Africa have been aggravated by the minimal enforcement of policies and rules by university administrators and managers. This has opened up opportunities for corrupt relationships between internal and external stakeholders seeking to embark on corrupt activities in universities. As corruption is a worldwide phenomenon, this study selected previously disadvantaged universities in South Africa to investigate the effectiveness of university administrators and managers. The research examines the enforcement of policies and regulations in the effort to curb corruption. Objective: The study further sought to determine the extent to which service providers and politicians are enabled to manipulate the supply chain management and procurement systems, convincing the university officials to overlook quality standards and specifications. Method: This study was suited to a multi-case study approach, and the qualitative method was used to obtain data. A sample of 20 respondents were approached from different employment categories, including departments, faculties and trade unions. Results: The major highlights of the study pointed to the following as being the dimensions of corrupt practices in universities: rules and regulations were not enforced by university officials. There were obvious corrupt relationships and agreements among corrupt individuals, without any action being taken against them; there was a clear corrupt relationship between internal and external forces, which included bribery by funders, service providers and suppliers; there was political interference from members of management and council members, driving the corruption agenda. Conclusion: To fill the gaps that enable corruption in universities, the development of an anti-corruption workforce is a necessity. This can be achieved through skills development, proper intelligence, cooperation from stakeholders, employees refusing gifts and/or bribes and consequence management for those who are driving corruption. Contribution: The findings of the study can be used to assist university stakeholders, agencies and decision-makers in understanding the nature and extent of the corruption that is prevalent in the institutions concerned. The research could have a positive influence on improving policy compliance and adding value regarding the scant literature on corruption in universities. © 2023. The Authors.

ABSTRACT: This practice-based paper presents the motivation, model and results of national level stakeholder collaboration for the development of engineering education. In addition, it presents how the results have been utilized in a case university. Stakeholder collaboration has been successfully used in the development of engineering education in Finland. University management, teachers, education developers, students as well as partners outside the universities such as industry representatives and policy makers all share an interest and a role in the development of engineering education. The Academic Engineers and Architects in Finland TEK has been active in facilitating the collaboration between key stakeholders, creating networks and forums of cooperation as well as ways of distributing the know-how and best practices of education development. One of the recent large scale stakeholder forums for was organized together by TEK and The Federation of Finnish Technology Industries in December 2014. The bi-annual two-day event attracted almost 90 representatives of university management, teachers, education developers, students, industry, research centers and policy makers. It is considered as one of the main networking and development forums in the field of engineering education. In addition to the strategic development of universities, the focus was on the future working life competencies; namely what they are and how can university education produce the skills and competencies needed. The aim of the event was to create tools and share best practices supporting competencies especially for the following multidisciplinary areas: career planning, sustainable development, innovation and entrepreneurship as well as sales and customer service. The key findings of the stakeholder workshop indicate that more emphasis should be put on the development of students self-esteem and confidence, communication and networking skills and in general the ?Yes, I can!?-attitude. Inspiring and systematic cooperation with industry and other stakeholders, such as visiting lecturers, traineeships, project work and case studies, as well as multidisciplinary team work and utilization of modern teaching technologies and learning facilities are some of the tools to be implemented in engineering education. In order for the tools to have an effect on education, they need to be put into practice. This paper examines, how a case university, in this case the School of Electrical Engineering in Aalto University, has been implementing new ideas and best practices gathered through collaboration with other universities and stakeholders.

ABSTRACT: Quality is a complex concept in higher education due to its value-laden nature, that is, different people mean different things. There are five notions of quality in higher education: quality as fitness for purpose, quality as excellence, quality as cost-effectiveness, quality as consistency, and quality as transformation. In the era of big data, most higher education data have not been transformed into actionable insights than other fields such as business intelligence in the companies. Quality is the lifeline of higher education in the universal stage of higher education development. Based on the five notions of quality, this paper aims to discuss how the five notions of quality relate to each other, who the key stakeholders are for each notion of quality, and how their data literacy will impact the quality of higher education. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: Rajamangala University of Technology, Thanyaburi, has produced a policy for the fiscal year 2022 to serve as an administrative development plan to help the university become an "innovative university that adds value to the society and country." The objective of this research was to study the policymaking of the university. The objectives were to look into four components – problem analysis, determination of development alternatives, alternative decision-making, and policy implementation. Interviews with committee members and university stakeholders were used to gather information. The results were as follows: Component 1: SWOT Analysis approach was used to highlight the institution's strengths as a guideline for the university's progress toward becoming innovative. Component 2: 5Hs and 5Is concepts were proposed to help students grow in becoming innovators and in determining development possibilities. Agro-food, Digital Economy, Creative Tourism Innovation, and Logistics were the four flagships of the research approach for innovation. There were credit & noncredit, upskill-reskill, and third-party in addition to standard courses. LEAN and Kaizen guided management as criteria for becoming an innovative institution. Component 3: The university will operate following the country's development strategy, the university's founding principles, and the ministry's laws, and corresponding to encountered issues in today's social setting. Before the policy was promulgated, the university's CEO made a decision authorized by the University Council. Component 4: The promulgation of the policy will take several approaches, namely, the preparation of strategic booklets, electronic media, the university website, and the circular notifications from the university to the faculties, colleges, and associated departments and their units and staff. The research suggests that limitations should be accepted and should work towards improving the university's ability to formulate succinct, clear policies that cover the university's objective toward an innovative university. © 2022, Association Res Militaris.

Theoretical expectations of youth involvement in university management

ABSTRACT: In the university environment, young people are for the most only seen as the recipients of interventions, most often education. When they are not on the receiving end, although they may be on the front end as researchers, professors or through other administrative roles, it is rare to have them resolutely involved in university management. Although their opinions might be taken into account through different committees, associations or clubs, it is usually uncommon that they have equal say in or direct influence over decision- making. This is rather disconcerting considering the fact that after all any decisions taken at the top management levels have for intended consequence the conditions of these same young people. In this sense, we believe, in accordance to an advanced version of the client-oriented model of policy evaluation that, as major stakeholders in university management, the role of the youth, regardless of their position in university, shouldn’t be limited to advisory functions as we often see but rather to contributory leadership positions. This paper assesses the expectations of youth involvement in university management, through a synthesis of the state-of-science of different theories, concept and frameworks that support the involvement of young leaders in education. © 2021 RJ4All.

ABSTRACT: This study explores the notion of organisational missions and goals held by the major stakeholders in university libraries in Ghana and assesses these visions for the libraries in relation to the development of a strategic planning process for the libraries. Multiple case studies were used to collect the data and the data were analysed using the multiple case study approach. The primary findings are that the major stakeholders in Ghanaian university libraries have different perceptions of the missions of their libraries. Two main perceptions emerged. The non-library stakeholders preferred a narrower mission for the libraries focused more on the needs of their institutions and emphasising collection development as the method of attaining excellence. The library stakeholders expressed a much broader mission defined in the context of national information provision, emphasising information access while at the same time balancing it with collection development. This multiplicity of strategic visions was found to be the subject of disagreement between decision-makers and the rest of the library staff. The study concludes with some ideas on how to address this situation. Copyright © Saur 1999.

ABSTRACT: With the recent Covid-19 pandemic, the way of teaching has rapidly turned into online learning environments. This situation has brought along various difficulties in the implementation of online teaching. From this point of view, this research focuses on the experiences of graduate students in the online teaching process and the multifaceted effects of this process on them. The research is a case study examining the opinions of 16 graduate students from various state and foundation universities in Türkiye. The maximum diversity sampling method, one of the purposeful sampling methods, was taken as a criterion in the determination of the participants. The data of the study were obtained with a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers. Thematic analysis technique was used in the analysis of the obtained data. Research results show that online education facilitates access to education, develops students’ self-discipline and awareness of taking responsibility; however, it has disadvantages in terms of social and psychological aspects. In addition, it has been concluded that online teaching is not yet ready to be considered as a stand-alone teaching delivery model, and it is more appropriate to use it as an alternative model to traditional face-to-face education. It is thought that the results obtained within the scope of the research will contribute to the improvement and development of online learning experiences of graduate students, as well as being a guide to higher education stakeholders and policymakers. © 2023, Ozgen Korkmaz.

ABSTRACT: The Bologna Follow Up Group (BFUG) is currently charged with discussing new priorities for the future of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and to this end has organized national consultations as well as discussions within the BFUG itself. In addition to defining new priorities, it appears essential to strengthen the awareness of the principles underlying higher education beyond national or even macro-regional borders. To go beyond lists of priorities and principles, however important and valid in themselves, it seems useful to elaborate a convincing holistic concept or way of visualizing the desired future of higher education and the EHEA's role in achieving it. Such a concept or vision can give direction to the continuing reform process and inspire countries and higher education institutions to work creatively together. To this end, the EHEA may need to transform itself from a loose intergovernmental framework to a more cohesive space where, supported by the necessary normative reforms, higher education institutions and their stakeholders can freely and effectively pursue their collaborative mission. The paper explores whether the goal of creating a 'European higher education community' by 2030 can help to give direction to this complex process and what that might entail. © The Author(s) 2020.

ABSTRACT: The Australian government Office for Learning and Teaching's (OLT) Resource Library (http://www.olt.gov.au/resources) is a key means of disseminating the outcomes from projects funded by itself and its predecessor organisations, the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) and the Carrick Institute. In order to apply the recommendations and resources emanating from these projects, it is vital that educators and other stakeholders are aware of, and effectively able to use, the Resource Library. Based on anecdotal evidence indicating a lack of awareness of the Resource Library and problems with consistently being able to search for and retrieve relevant resources from the database, the OLT commissioned a project to formally evaluate the Library and redesign it to improve access and usability. This paper reports on the project's progress, including the results from a questionnaire completed by 117 higher education stakeholders.

ABSTRACT: As an inevitable result of Russia’s higher education policies of the past two decades, new university leaders in and outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg have emerged, and vertical differentiation has increased. Inequality of educational potential has a strong regional dimension, exerting a considerable delayed impact on regional socioeconomic development. Differences in universities’ resources affected their ability to adapt their instructional, research, and administrative processes during the pandemic, thus broadening the education and research quality gap in higher education. Some regions may face an increased outflow of youth talent to universities based in Moscow and St. Petersburg, that will certainly weaken the socioeconomic growth prospects of Russia’s regions. The pandemic accelerated the debate over this problem and demonstrated readiness of universities for joint efforts. This leads to an expansion of policy to create a cooperative network of universities and their stakeholders so as to reduce institutional differentiation and promote exchange of experience and competence among universities. This paper investigates into the main characteristics of vertical differentiation in Russian higher education that had been in place when the pandemic broke out and determined whether universities succeeded or failed in switching to distance learning. Furthermore, lockdown measures and their economic impact on different types of universities are analyzed. Finally, we discuss possible avenues and specific considerations for expanding cross-institutional collaboration and engaging stakeholders in university development. © 2021, Mir Rossii.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study is to develop a common perception of Stakeholders regarding the Internal Supervision Unit. Internal Audit is a part of internal program control function which is responsible for independent reviewer practices of the organization’s role and performance. A tertiary educational institution holds a strategic role in regards to higher educational purposes. Therefore, adequate management systems are required through internal audit. The object of this study is Nusa Cendana University Kupang NTT Province. Data were collected through questionnaire, interviews, and documentations. Data analysis employed SWOT analysis method. The Perceptions of Nusa Cendana University’s stakeholder regarding the Internal Supervision Unit lies within the1st quadrant which represents comparative advantage. The Internal Supervision Unit which is positioned in the connection of SO with a strength score of 3.52 and opportunity score of 2.66, precedes 1.85 points. These points to a SO strategy which emphasizes on using strengths and identified opportunities in order to enhance the performances of the Internal Supervision Unit. This in turn is expected to shift the bureaucracy paradigm in Nusa Cendana University, which will give an opportunity for the Internal Supervision Unit to develop significantly. The conclusions of this study are: 1)Stakeholders’ perception has recognized change from negative views of the Internal Supervision Unit which sees them as watchdogs;a mere executive extension and “problem seeker”, to a more positive view which sees the control unit as a consulting peer. 2) The presence of the Internal Supervision Unit can prevent fraud, 3) The Internal Supervision Unit work set up by strong legal basis 4) The Internal auditors carry out their duties fully based on regulations and procedures. © 2019, Universidad del Zulia.

ABSTRACT: There is currently a global movement toward open, digital, reusable educational resources. However, despite the often existing infrastructure and resource capacities of many higher education institutions (HEIs), the introduction of Open Educational Resources (OER) has not yet become a normative practice in all faculties and disciplines. The reasons for this are not immediately apparent to HEIs, and it is difficult to make an assessment of how well a HEI is positioned with regard to OER. For this purpose, the paper presents an initial draft of a maturity model for OER, consisting of six dimensions and five levels. This maturity model was subsequently evaluated and assessed by various higher education stakeholders through an online survey. The evaluation confirmed the dimensions and levels, but identified the need for adaption within the dimension and in the gradation of the levels. The model represents a first step to provide HEIs with important information about the current state regarding OER and to identify areas in need of improvement. The aim is to increase the acceptance of OER in practice by supporting HEIs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: In this unique and timely book Losing the Mother Tongue in the USA: Implications for Adult Latinx in the 21st Century, Thorsos, Martínez and Gabriel highlight Latinx scholars and colleagues as they explore the value of 21st century bilingualism in the United States of America (USA). Using critical counternarratives and testimonios to highlight their individual, and sometimes collective, experiences as each Indigenous Latinx author examines the profound and diverse reasons they experience a loss of their Spanish mother tongue. Through individual testimonios, each author addresses the main objectives of the book: (a) to share Latinx motives and purposes needed to assimilate or acculturate in the USA, (b) to reflect on the navigation necessary to be successful within a whitestream education system and job market, and (c) to provide a cautionary story to parents, educators, and all Americans about the dangers of Spanish language loss. At a time when Latinxs continue to be the fastest growing population in the USA at all levels of education, this volume opens up critical dialogue that fills a void in the academic literature, especially as it relates to language, identity, and culture. Losing the Mother Tongue in the USA is an important book for this time and era for much needed insight into how multicultural education can be decolonized, theorized, and practiced from the perspective of cultural insiders; thereby honoring the unique voice and experiences of Latinxs. With the USA being built on the backs of Latinx labor, this book is long overdue in acknowledging Latinx intellectualism and expertise. The book has implications for ethnic studies, faculty and staff in higher education, and teacher education, intended for use by both undergraduate and graduate students, multicultural education scholars, administrators, policy makers, and internal and external stakeholders in higher education. The chapters in this book may also provide valuable contributions to the literature on Spanish language loss for master and doctoral students, and further serve as an excellent reference for professoriate interested in the language dispositions and contexts of bilingualism, multilingualism, multiculturalism, nationalism, and globalism. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

ABSTRACT: Learning institutions and universities have made a huge and forced transition to full online learning modality in the school year 2020-2021. Specifically, before this, blended learning environments have taken its place in most educational setup and it is customary to allow students, pertaining to as the voice of the customer to provide immediate feedback through surveys to collect views covering their satisfaction in the entire course as the semester concludes. In Jose Rizal University, student feedback is gathered in several survey instruments. One is the Canvas Experience Survey, which allows students to submit feedback on the effectiveness of the blended learning course implementation. It seeks student feedback on areas where the teaching and learning process could be improved. This paper creates a venue for educational interventions directly from the students, as the voice of the customer. It creates a course feedback mining system that will allow the administrators to examine the shortcomings of their clients' blended learning experiences and, as a result, intervene to improve them. An analysis of the student responses from Canvas experience survey is presented quantitatively and a qualitative text mining approach comprising of text pre-processing using lemmatization and n-gram, aspect extraction, sentiment analysis employing VADER, and recommendatory statement action plan intervention shall be accessed by institution's respective groups supporting them to the continuous improvement of the teaching and learning cycle implementation of blended learning courses. A mean of the numerical value of the selected course totals to 3.71 interpreted as Strongly Agree and an overall sentiment polarity score of 0.14 resulting in a positive sentiment. The correlation r value is -0.43 which results in a moderate relationship. As aspects were extracted from responses from each question, educational interventions through statement action plans are accessed by the respective office to address these concerns. Therefore, prelude to full online learning modality, the students' voice was heard, and it expedites the University stakeholders in the improvement cycle to courses offered under the blended learning programs of the University.

ABSTRACT: This introduction to the COVID-19 Special Section highlights the importance for targeted reflection on pandemic experiences, mutual understanding of perspectives and best practice sharing by and across stakeholder groups. Higher education, similar to other global sectors, has been profoundly shaken by the realities brought about since March 2020, and different stakeholders have felt the impact and consequences of the pandemic on a daily basis. Reports of challenges go a long way towards enabling understanding; however, unless these are combined with demonstrations of responses in context and analyses of their effectiveness, they remain at the level of awareness and cannot move towards action. Sharing the lessons learned, alerting to specificities and gaining perspectives have never been more timely, as higher education shapes future models for enhanced stakeholder experiences within increased quality parameters. Notwithstanding the disruptive effect on societies, COVID-19 must also be recognised as an accelerator for higher education, impacting digitalisation, accessibility and creating opportunities for new approaches to educational delivery and collaboration. The papers in this Special Section cover a variety of contexts, moving swiftly from Spain to Poland to the United States of America, India and Iran to return to Europe, i.e. Slovenia. Authors tackle specific challenges experienced by stakeholders, be they students, teaching and administrative staff, researchers or policy makers, and discuss lessons learned, highlight perceived benefits and recommend how these may be translated into policy and practice. © 2022 University of Deusto.

ABSTRACT: The National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) and the Growth of the University Sub-sector in Uganda, 2002-2012, narrates the experience of the Ugandan NCHE in the establishment, development and regulation of higher education institutions in Uganda from 2002 to 2012. In this period, student numbers in higher education institutions increased from about 65,000 to some 200,000 and university institutions from about ten to more than triple the number. The book discusses the role of a regulatory agency in the delivery of higher education, the relations of universities and colleges with such an agency, its impact on developing university capacities, and leadership in creating and refining higher education ideas. The experience of Uganda's regulatory agency, the NCHE, in those ten years should help both the Ugandan and other African countries' higher education stakeholders in sharing lessons learned from this one case study. The author sees the roles of regulatory agencies as vital in the initial stages of building a higher education sub-sector and in periods of system transitions such as the current journey from elite to mass systems but is of the view that the university remains the home of knowledge creation, dissemination, and its application in society. © CODESRIA 2016.

ABSTRACT: The impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was felt worldwide and has been a growing topic of discussion. Specifically, this book explores the challenges and costs that have hit the higher education sector due to COVID-19 pandemic. As such, 31 eminent authors from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds from public and private higher education institutions in the Arab world and Europe address how to mitigate these challenges and build a resilient higher education system; a system that should be well prepared not only to face emergencies in the future, but also one that fits the needs of a growingly diverse student body and an ever-changing labor market. Even before COVID-19, the higher education sector was facing significant challenges. This book provides an opportunity for higher education stakeholders to reimagine the higher education system, re-think the purpose of a university education and pedagogy, re-design the students’ experiences, and evaluate business models. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, the authors conducted a study on higher education governance of big data. Big data can be described as the amount of data created which is beyond the technical capacity to be efficiently processed, stored, and managed. There are six objectives for the study, which are to investigate the characteristics of big data in higher education, in how big data contributes to higher education, how to govern big data in higher education, the higher educational governance models, the roles of government in managing higher education and the big data initiative in the developing nations. Kitchenham methodology is adopted in this study to carry out a systematic literature review. The finding, therefore, reveals that the characteristics of big data include value, velocity, volume, veracity, and variety. The findings show that big data contributes to higher education by given real-time feedback, monitor students'school performance. It shows that big data can be used for the detection of attrition risk, data visualization, students's skill estimation, and grouping and collaborations among the students. It also shows that big data can be governed through provisions of information security, compliances, and ensuring privacy. This chapter, therefore, contributed data quality and accountability as other methods of governing big data. Therefore, the authors recommend the future study to cover data stakeholders in higher education. © 2021 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The recommendation of the Council of European Union of December 2012 introduced the concept of equal value of standards used to obtain qualifications through validation of non-formal and informal learning and standards used in formal education, with recommended implementation of such validation systems in all EU member states by 2018. This triggered policy development in a number of EU member states including Croatia in order to propose new legislation, quality assurance recommendations and support to such provision. This article presents the results of three quantitative research studies in higher education which involved a total of 2027 participants from different stakeholder groups relevant for the recognition of prior learning in higher education. The results reveal general support to the concept with lack of understanding of its full implications and significant differences in approaches and attitudes of higher education institutions and other stakeholders, especially users of validation, towards assessment standards, assessment methods and use of learning outcomes. This implies that changes in assessment concepts and more use of summative methods based on standards linked to national qualifications framework might be slower and harder to implement in Croatia than EU level policy makers might expect. © 2017, FACTEACHEREDUCATION.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, Michelle M. Espino offers a scholarly informed analysis and reflection on essays by a college student, a research analyst for the Department of Education, a high school student, and a dean of college counseling at a high school. The essays offer responses to the question: What are the needs of today’s college students? While all essayists are stakeholders in higher education, they inhabit very different positions and social locations in relation to the academy. In this chapter, an examination of these narratives reveals important points of congruence and areas of discrepancies in their views on today’s college students. This chapter explores these areas of agreement and difference, connects resulting themes to extant theory of student learning and development, and concludes with a call to action for readers to activate on behalf of college students, no matter their positionality. © 2023 Taylor and Francis.

ABSTRACT: While changes in society continue to inform understandings of what leisure is and how it manifests itself, the emergence of Chinese outbound tourists, with specific motivations, travel styles and leisure choices are having powerful impacts on multiple host destinations. While university campuses have long been marked as visitor attractions in China, this study explores the motivations and implications of outbound Chinese tourists visiting university campuses abroad for leisure. On site qualitative interviews took place with 25 fully independent Chinese tourists at three campuses in Seoul, South Korea and a campus in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The study results found that Chinese visitors mark specific university campuses as attractions and are motivated to visit because of their prestige, by novelty and exploration, emotion and nostalgia and learning and knowledge seeking. This study argues that campus tourism may be difficult to develop and manage as a well-defined product that meets the needs of Chinese tourists, university governors and university stakeholders. The study explores the implications for universities and recommends universities begin a critical evaluation of prestige markers and especially those markers present in the Chinese cultural, pop-culture and (social) media context, which may be counterproductive to the primary mission of universities. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: Higher education institutions are facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges due to the rapid development of global contexts. With the momentum of higher education internationalization, leading universities in China began to launch international summer programs. These summer programs offer multiple benefits to university stakeholders, especially students. This chapter reviews the context and characteristics for international programs in leading Chinese universities. The significant role these programs play in designing an innovative learning platform were argued by reviewing and analyzing the trends among sample programs on aspects of curriculum design and implementation. The authors provide an in-depth understanding of students' learning outcomes during these programs by conducting a qualitative study utilizing sample summer programs. Last but not least, the opportunities and challenges concerning the organization and implementation of programs were analyzed and possible recommendations were proposed for future study abroad improvements. © 2016 by IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: Recent research has investigated how personal values of university stakeholders shape social responsibility of universities. Interest of universities for their responsibility toward society, beyond fundamental academic goals related to creating, transferring and preserving knowledge in society has become more widespread since 1970s. As social responsibility has evolved, universities have started to look into questions about mechanisms through which beliefs, values, attitudes impact their socially responsible behavior. This chapter provides an insight into the role of university stakeholders' personal values to creation of social responsibility of higher education institutions and explain how their values accelerate development of broader society. Findings enable new understanding of current state of social responsibility in higher education and suggest possible solutions for its improvment. © 2020, IGI Global. All Rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: This study empirically analyzes a comprehensive model of university identification. The study investigates the role of university brand personality (UP), university brand knowledge (UBK), university brand prestige (UBP) in improving university identification (UI) in terms of stakeholders. The study also explores whether UI elicited brand-supportive behaviors such as suggestions for improvements, university affiliation (UA), advocacy intentions (AI) and participation in future activities of stakeholders. The model is analyzed using data collected from local people, students and employees of a public university. A total of 1000 usable surveys were obtained. The structural equation modeling was used to analyze hypotheses. The study contributes to this literature by enhancing our understanding of under-researched university identification in higher education. The results show that UBK and prestige positively affect university identification. Additionally, university identification is positively associated with suggestions for university improvements (SUI), UA AI and participation in future university activities (FUA) of stakeholders. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

ABSTRACT: Learning analytics show promise to support study success in higher education. Hence, they are increasingly adopted in higher education institutions. This study examines higher education stakeholders’ views on learning analytics utilisation to support study success. Our main research question was to investigate how ready higher education institutions are to adopt learning analytics. We derived policy guidelines from an international systematic review of the last five years of learning analytics research. Due to the lack of rigorous learning analytics research and adoption, this study examines how ready university stakeholders are to adopt learning analytics. In order to validate the guidelines, we conducted an interview study with 37 higher education stakeholders. The majority of participants stated that their institutions required further resources in order to adopt learning analytics but were able to identify what these resources were in order for successful implementation. Overall, stakeholders agree that learning analytics show much promise to support study success at higher education institutions. © ASCILITE 2019 Singapore University of Social Sciences.

Re-naming "hometown u" university of South Carolina Beaufort assumes a new role

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930861899&partnerID=40&md5=a06123b3666d802ce79e3f25bafa21f9

ABSTRACT: Case Introduction: This case describes a university identity change and the subsequent re-naming and rebranding process. Secondary issues include strategic marketing, branding, services marketing, non-profit marketing, public policy, higher education leadership, legislative relations, and consensus management. The case is designed for graduate students and doctoral students in public administration, higher education leadership and business. The case can be taught in a single, 2 hour class session. Student preparation, including team meetings and research will require 4 hours. Case Synopsis: An entrepreneurial "comprehensive" university seeks to raise its visibility to grow rapidly. USCB changed its role and mission from a 2 year campus on eight acres in the small town of Beaufort, SC to a "full service" university with a newly constructed, technology rich campus on 200 acres at the gateway to Hilton Head Island. Rapid enrollment growth, declining state appropriations and increasing competition for students demand marketing leadership. Renaming offers the most powerful--and the most risky--strategy to position this "new" university and sustain its growth trajectory. The student plays the role of branding manager at a critical decision point: should this university attempt a name change now? The student designs and implements a successful change process, showing sensitivity to multiple, diverse audiences and stakeholders. Students tackle branding in a service marketing setting, where the faculty who create the service also lead organizational governance. The complexities of government and nonprofit management become apparent as students identify the participants in the branding process (students, faculty, system leaders, board members, legislators, mayors, community leaders, donors). Because master's and doctoral students are university stakeholders themselves and have significant personal experience with higher education, they quickly grasp the context and issues, then move into a deeper consideration of underlying concepts. Students are challenged to think about branding in a nonprofit setting, where consensus is valued and marketing leaders can have the perfect business case for change--but fail without sensitivity to the culture of the organization and the political environment. Provide student teams with specific assignments prior to the class discussion to move them beyond focusing on the "best name" to designing the branding/change process. Teams will represent different stakeholder audiences, list that audience's concerns, and represent them in the ensuing class discussion. Each team must propose a new name for USCB and a process to build support for that name with all stakeholder audiences.

ABSTRACT: In this chapter, Laura A. Dean and Jason Wallace offer a scholarly informed analysis and reflection on essays by a CEO of an education-related organization, a college student, a state House representative, and a university president. The essays offer responses to the question: Who are today’s college students? While all essayists are stakeholders in higher education, they inhabit very different positions and social locations in relation to the academy. In this chapter, an examination of these narratives reveals important points of congruence and areas of discrepancies in their views on today’s college students. This chapter explores these areas of agreement and difference, connects resulting themes to extant theory of student learning and development, and concludes with a call to action for readers to activate on behalf of college students, no matter their positionality. © 2023 Taylor and Francis.

ABSTRACT: This paper reports on a competitive benchmarking study to gauge where Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) stands with respect to six other top universities in Malaysia, based on the perception of the universities’ stakeholders (potential employers) on ten different relevant performance attributes. Compromised-AHP was used to calculate the performance score obtained by each university with regards to each performance attribute. The findings, based on 92 evaluations received revealed that although UUM was only recently ranked fifth among the seven universities selected for this study (based on the 2019 Times Higher Education Asia University Rankings), UUM surprisingly scored comparatively well in all the performance attributes except for one performance attribute, the English language proficiency of the graduates. However, although UUM is perceived to comparatively performing better than the other six universities, overall, the actual performance is perceived to be only at the level of slightly above average. The findings are very beneficial to UUM in the sense that by knowing which aspects that UUM is perceived by the potential employers to be lacking and require further improvements, appropriate strategies can be formulated and undertaken by the UUM management to strengthen its performance.

ABSTRACT: Due to the rapid digitalization of Higher Education, universities and colleges have access to more student data than ever before, allowing for real-time analysis of student behaviour and learning results. To evaluate the quality of curriculum and teaching practices, some institutions have relied on curriculum analytics ôÄ≠ a subfield of learning analytics aiming to leverage educational data for improving program quality and student learning. So far, some promising tools have been developed to inform curriculum renewal strategies. However, this is still an emerging research area, so little is known about how it supports continuous curriculum improvement in different university settings. More robust design-based research is needed to understand how curriculum analytics helps higher education stakeholders gain better understanding of student outcome attainment. This chapter presents a research agenda that reflects on the importance of promoting continuous curriculum improvement and the research challenges for using curriculum analytics for this purpose. © Jeroen Huisman and Marijk van der Wende 2022.

ABSTRACT: Education for sustainable development (ESD) is key for all stakeholders in higher education who want to move forward in terms of sustainability. No matter how universities may structure main fields of action—like research, teaching, the so-called “third mission” or outreach respectively, governance, and operation management—ESD undeniably represents the core of implementing sustainability at universities. Unfortunately, however, despite several agenda-setting efforts at political, governmental, and higher education systems’ levels and notwithstanding considerable progression leading universities have made, ESD still seems to be in its infancy in the entire higher education system. This paper focuses on the role of ESD at and designed by universities specialized in distance and online learning, making clear their considerable and specific impact in the light of the whole institution approach. First, conceptual considerations are presented twofold: (i) the morphological box for ESD provides a powerful development tool for ESD implementation, and (ii) key ESD characteristics of distance and online learning processes and institutions are presented. Second, good practice examples for ESD program development and specific distance and online learning formats are shown, focusing on the case of Wilhelm Büchner Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany’s largest Mobile University of Technology. Finally, conclusions are drawn, and recommendations for action are given, addressing all those interested in the further development of ESD in distance and online learning formats. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Earning capacity of sustainable education -a review of current perceptions regarding the salaries, under-employment and over-education of higher-education graduates and their potential application in sustainability assessments

ABSTRACT: There is a growing need to understand the economic returns of degrees as a function of a sustainable institution. The empirical data presented in this paper suggests that there is a difference between the economic perception of higher education stakeholders and reality. The data showed that the most important economic metric for a graduate is full-time employment. This metric, although important, is incomplete and does not address other important factors such as starting salaries and under-employment. This indicates a gap between reality and perception considering stakeholders expectation that education should not cost more than of 15% of future salaries and that the debt be repaid in less than ten years. Student's focusing on full-time employment rather than the holistic economic realities of their educational choices may lead to an unsustainable future which is currently not captured in higher education sustainability assessments.

ABSTRACT: The last decade has seen ongoing interest in teaching online, driven in part by changing market demand and abundant technical opportunities to facilitate this. Coupled with different time and skill demands, the role of university teachers has expanded to include the ability to plan, develop and deliver successful online and blended learning modules. This chapter explores the process of designing and delivering online modules through the use of ADDIE, a widely-used instructional design model to illustrate the key steps from evaluating needs to evaluating and refining what is delivered to students. We draw on our experience of developing and delivering online learning to encourage a greater understanding of how students learn online as well as the development needs of all university stakeholders to engage and support this. Practical approaches to developing content and structuring online resources are presented. © Kathy Daniels, Caroline Elliott, Simon Finley and Colin Chapman 2019. All rights reserved.

ABSTRACT: The North-East Social Work Alliance was formed in 2016 following a successful application for Government funding in the second wave of Teaching Partnerships. The formation of this Teaching Partnership enabled the development of new and innovative ways of working between higher education institutions and their partner agencies. Four years on this has resulted in a complex network of relationships combining well established existing partnerships with new partnerships and stakeholder arrangements that transcend institutional boundaries. This paper explores the impact the North-East Social Work Alliance has had on stakeholder relationships between one university and its partner agencies. By examining the perspectives of the university and its practice partners, it explores structural and operational relationships and critically examines the enhanced model of partnership working that Teaching Partnerships have facilitated. It concludes that overall Teaching Partnerships have promoted enhanced relationships between higher education institutions and their stakeholders. However, it identifies areas that should be addressed within future governance arrangements by Teaching Partnerships and similar partnership programmes internationally in order to maximise the impact such programmes have on social work education. © 2021 The Author(s).

ABSTRACT: Sustainability in higher education institutions should mostly be achieved and/or enhanced with concrete actions. This chapter examines the role of knowledge management for sustainable development in universities. Based on the literature synthesis and trends, the aim of this chapter is to propose a conceptual framework for knowledge management in higher education institutions, based on business process modelling principles. The study´s methodology is based on the idea of measuring graduates perception regarding the transferred knowledge by using statistical data and business process management tools. The study was supported by the development of a process framework for knowledge management in order to meet stakeholders’ needs and to improve quality. The framework could be applied in higher education institutions in order to assure sustainable development and to create knowledge and skills for future generations. Also, sustainable universities could be a model for any organization that wants to embark knowledge generation in the process of continuous improvement in its relation with society. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

ABSTRACT: The article examines challenges faced by academics in Zimbabwe's universities. With a particular focus on university teaching and research, the article draws upon empirical evidence from a survey study and in-depth semi-structured interviews with academics from four public universities. The survey findings suggest that years of university teaching experience, area of specialisation, professional title, and education levels are not strong determinants on the academics’ view towards political instability as one of the main issues impacting their work. The qualitative interview data provide further evidence on how all the different academics consider political instability as a factor negatively impacting university teaching and research. The most significant finding is that academics blame government policies. The article identifies the variegated market-oriented policies adopted in the university as the cause of the challenges and consequently calls for an interrogation of the policy from Zimbabwean academics and all other concerned stakeholders in higher education. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

ABSTRACT: This chapter contributes to the topical area of higher education marketing by exploring how branding adds value to universities. The primary focus of exploring branding concepts associated with successful higher education brands in a UK context was chosen for this work with a view to later comparison with other countries such as the United States, where branding of universities has a longer practical and academic history. The concept of "successful" brands was explored through the extant literature, and the subsequent research identified constructs underpinning a successful university brand. These constructs were then tested among a larger sample of UK university stakeholders. The findings explored the variables associated with successful university brands and suggested significant relationships among these variables. A further stage involved qualitative exploration of current perceptions and practices in HE branding, designed to maintain currency and build ongoing research possibilities. Overall, the chapter offers suggestions for both academia and practice on what underpins a successful university brand, and the variables associated with these brands. © 2014, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: At the height of technological revolution and the transformation of economic and social needs in the knowledge-based society, the significant step for both policymakers and educators is to consider joining the force in creating common spaces in higher education. At the inter-governmental level, the attempt to collaborate for new learning, teaching, and research spaces is in progress in many regions, especially in Europe, Central and Latin America as well as Africa. Besides the needs to use education, especially higher education, to be the driving force in the globalized world for economic growth and to increase regional competitiveness and social cohesion, these common spaces and higher education areas are also designed to meet the needs of the students and to accommodate the new paradigm of education. Politically and economically speaking, a higher education space or area certainly provides some answers to the challenges of higher education development in the globalized world. It directly tackles common problems faced by many countries and HEIs around the world, that is, the problems of access/equity, quality, and participation of key stakeholders in higher education sector. Through the creation of a common space in higher education, an ‘area’ in which higher education systems in the region share common features could be formed. It is also an area where educational, research, and training activities could be conducted with the same standards or guidelines of assessment, recognition, and quality. It is essentially a ‘loosely-coordinated and voluntary policy process’ that facilitates far better cooperation in higher education within the region. In a way, it is a search for a common answer to common problems in higher education sector in each region. © National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration 2020, corrected publication 2021.

ABSTRACT: The concept of quality is ambiguous and still under development - various studies in different fields of science expand the parameters of its analysis and open up a space for new insights. Recently, the researches in quality in higher education discuss quality issues in the context of changes that occur in the field of higher education. The role of the stakeholders in the quality assurance system could be linked to systemic procedural mechanisms - ways in which stakeholders are involved, how relationships among stakeholders and higher education institutions are developed. In scientific discourse, the role of stakeholders in quality assurance systems is linked to systemic procedural mechanisms and depends on the stakeholders' interests. The scientific literature highlights the assumptions of quality as a traveling idea, but there is no research on the transfer of quality as an idea to the context of a higher education institution. This article analyzes the concept of quality in higher education through the theoretical perspective of Scandinavian institutionalism and examines the expression of quality as an idea in the strategic documents of higher education institutions. Indicators of quality applied for the analysis of the expression of quality as an idea in the strategic documents of higher education institution demonstrate the transfer of quality as an idea into the context of a higher education institution based on the interests of stakeholders. The roles of stakeholders in higher education institutions are different, so quality, as an idea, and its transfer to higher education institutions is assessed by different indicators, which express quality (quality as an idea) in higher education institutions based on the expectations of different stakeholders. © 2018 Valius Venckunas.

ABSTRACT: The common aim of all stakeholders in Higher Education is to improve the learning and teaching outcomes for students, to ultimately enhance their student experience. One key way to meet this aim is through student participation and engagement with the teaching of the module. Whilst independent learning is, justifiably, applauded as one of the cornerstones of HE, student engagement through attendance in classes makes a significant contribution to their progress and achievement at both modular and programme level. The aim of this chapter is to share my practice for encouraging attendance and engagement on traditional platforms of teaching at HE through lectures, tutorials and seminars. However, the practices discussed in this chapter are equally applicable to non-traditional methods such as webinars, online tests or listening to podcasts. © Kathy Daniels, Caroline Elliott, Simon Finley and Colin Chapman 2019.

ABSTRACT: Knowledge Management (KM) has been introduced to fulfil the need of managing Knowledge Asset (KA), in enabling knowledge transferring among members of organization. Knowledge Management System (KMS) is one alternative in managing KA, using Information and Communication Technology (ICT), in order to derive a competitive advantageous for higher education. KMS able to provide knowledge access through effective navigation of higher education institutions members, to facilitate the high expectation of higher education stakeholders. Anyhow, those KMS frameworks from literature only provide proposition of general knowledge content. The KMS framework is lacking the structure of the KA; to be selected and included in any KMS initiatives. This study aimed at proposing KA Structuring Process Framework for KMS designer, to structure the KA in the KMS, or for any other knowledge management initiatives, that need to structure the KA as contents. Data was collected from literature, related to KA structuring process in three domains that are in Library and Information Management, Knowledge Organization and Information System domain. The literature review extracted processes and components used in conducting the KA structuring process. The analysis of literature, also derived a conclusion that Taxonomy approach, was found complement the purpose of structuring KA, that is for navigation purpose. As a result, this study reported the conceptual framework that consists of three elements for KA Structuring Process, that are: Taxonomy Development Phases, Taxonomy Classification Techniques, and finally Taxonomy Development Standard and Guidelines. The result need to be tested by applying the conceptual framework to KA Structuring Process Project. Copyright © 2018 International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA).

ABSTRACT: Higher education institutions (HEI) or universities are known as knowledge and learning centres that produce skilled human capital, educate productive workers and entrepreneurs. Their functions have changed with current demands of society, making significant their role in stimulating and sustaining economic growth. However, there are few studies that investigate the effects of the establishment of universities to cater for and address local economic development. This study aims to examine the spill over effects of universities in nurturing local business activities. With regards to universities, the study explores the (i) stakeholders' spending impact; faculty, staff, student and visitors; (ii) human capital impact and; (iii) knowledge and exploration impact of business growth. Using a Structural Equation Model (SEM), the research applies multistage sampling to survey 445 university stakeholders involving alumni, community and industry from three universities; (i) University of Technology Malaysia (UTM); (ii) Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) and; (iii) Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT). The findings show that university expenditure, human capital and knowledge exploration positively influence local business growth. This affirms a positive spill-over effects of universities to regional business growth. Hence, the findings of the research suggest that the positive roles of universities to the local economic development need to be given a priority by related stakeholders. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.
